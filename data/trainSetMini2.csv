124,um I found the voltage for R0 and then divided it by 330,CEC-R,1
125,round up if you have to,CP-S,7
126,"it will change a bit, keep playing with the resistors",CEC-S,2
127,I'm back where I started but I'm not changing anything till I get something on paper,CEC-R,1
128,we need to calculate E,CP-G,6
129,got it,CMC-S,5
130,on2,SESU-A,10
131,mine is also 3V,SSI-O,17
132,goal is 2.5. I assume its the same for all of us,SSI-O,17

140,I have 2.35,SSI-O,17
141,someone else should try,CP-S,7
142,i think so not sure didnt write everything from that video,SSI-U,19
143,So the current is about .013,SSI-O,17
144,i'm at 2.7 kiliohms,SSI-O,17
145,mines at 330k,SSI-O,17
146,Gucci. mine was 100,SSI-O,17
147,tkf,SMC-O,13
148,im lost in the sauce,SSI-U,19
149,mine's 2.25 volts,SSI-O,17
150,"Tiger, can you connect your wires? then we can measure our voltages",CP-S,7
151,Mine is 3.75,SSI-O,17
152,Yea I know E is the voltage,SN-A,15
153,sorry or confusion,SMC-R,14
154,ok are you pointing to the DCV thing,SESU-P,11
155,there is something we are overlooking here,SSI-U,19
156,So my target voltage is 3.75V,SSI-O,17
157,i just got the anser,SSI-U,19
158,so for this i think we need to set up a system of equations where when we change the voltage we need to calculate the total voltage and set it equal to each other and then find current,CP-S,7
159,ohms*,SESU-A,10
160,sorry,SMC-R,14
161,lion put ur resistor back to how it was b4,CEC-S,2

164,3.25,SSI-O,17
165,someone unplugged a wire im getting 0 volts now,SSI-O,17
166,ok,SESU-A,10
167,im r1,SSI-O,17
168,you have to submit the battery voltage first,CP-S,7
169,Iowa and I will set to 100 and Ohio do you want to test resistors about 100?,SESU-P,11

186,try 47?? hawk,CEC-S,2
187,i was wrong,SSI-U,19
188,omg,SMC-R,14
189,We should divide our voltage goal by the resistor value we have to find the current that is the same throughout the circuit. Then plug in E=IxR0 + IxR1 + IxR2 + xR3. because then we will have the same I value across the whole circuit to use,CP-S,7
190,"3,25",SSI-O,17

399,that's why you had to set up a user name,SMC-O,13
400,mine is 0.027125,SSI-O,17
401,"Lets let Hawk gets theirs right first, and we can move down the circut",CP-S,7
402,But its the total voltage that needs to be calculated,CP-G,6
403,im on 470,SSI-O,17
404,now i read 2.33,SSI-O,17
405,e=IR,SSI-O,17
406,I use 270,CEC-R,1
407,green try going to 270 ohm,CEC-S,2
408,lets just all try 120,CP-S,7
409,what are you at ice cream,CMC-G,4
410,shall we all try what we get with ohm's law and see if it works?,SESU-P,11
411,i=.011899,SSI-O,17
412,2.37 now,SSI-O,17
413,did it,CEC-R,1
414,red you see it?,SESU-P,11
415,i'm at 100 Ohms right now. everyone else?,SESU-P,11
416,e=14 v R0= 560 ohms R3=56 Ohms,SSI-O,17
417,how do we do this,SESU-P,11
418,so we all need to change our resistor value to 560 ohm?,SESU-P,11
419,1.31*120,SSI-O,17
420,1.31*120,SMC-O,13
421,"I', gettig 1.81",SSI-O,17
422,They should put formula on the top,SMC-O,13
423,im at 1000,SSI-O,17
424,okay so use .11 for the current?,SESU-P,11
425,my goal is 7.15 but im at 7.30,CMC-S,5
426,ohio start,CEC-S,2
427,rain can you move you resistance around?,CEC-S,2
428,Ok so our resistance will all be the same,CRF-R,9
429,so now what,SESU-P,11
430,got mine,CMC-S,5
431,think so,SN-A,15
432,i did too,SESU-A,10
433,im so sorry i cucked us,SMC-I,12
434,hawk don't do anything,CEC-S,2
435,who is r1,SESU-P,11
436,Each resistor affects the others so do we need to coordinate and pick ones at the same time,CP-S,7
437,We have to adjust our resistance so that the current increases,CP-S,7
438,easier to add,SSI-O,17
439,someone try going up see if that works,CP-S,7
440,Did everyone change to 270?,SESU-P,11
441,20,SSI-O,17
442,lion?,CMC-G,4
443,so v0 has to be 1.15,SSI-O,17
444,1.07,SSI-O,17
445,its the same problem,CRF-R,9
446,everyoe set to 1k,CP-S,7
447,please!,SMC-R,14
448,everyone to 100 ohms again?,CP-S,7
449,it keeps changing,SSI-O,17
450,ok,SESU-A,10
451,i got my voltage,CMC-S,5
452,3.06,SSI-O,17
453,i typed 17 V,CEC-R,1
454,.08 high,CMC-S,5
455,yea what value do u have on the resistor,SN-A,15
456,so divide your v by .15,CP-S,7
457,Hey,SMC-R,14
458,we have to find a way to express r0 in terms of the values we do have,CP-G,6
459,I think that all of us,CRF-F,8
460,im confused as heck,SSI-U,19
461,0,SSI-O,17
462,you resistor in the middle,SSI-T,18
463,At least we tried.,SMC-R,14
464,RIP your calculator,SMC-O,13
465,sweet lets do it,SMC-R,14
466,im at 10 ohms but my voltage is -0.11,SSI-O,17
467,Don't forget the R0 value too!,SSI-O,17
468,all of them,CMC-S,5
469,yup,SN-A,15
470,so 1.13v is R0,SSI-O,17
471,register as 680,CP-S,7
472,"ok, everyone set resistance to 100",CP-S,7
473,okay so maybe we set up a particular resistance like we all take 1k resuistors,SESU-P,11
474,currently 1k ohms at 9.83,SSI-O,17
475,RIGHT?,SESU-P,11
476,I think one person should do the calculations and tell the rest what to do so we aren't switching it on eachother. What do you think?,CP-S,7
477,im at 1.97 V,SSI-O,17
478,I'm not sure what to plug in,SSI-U,19
479,increase by one level,CP-S,7
480,how do i calculate the current in thihs?,SESU-P,11
481,me too,SESU-A,10
482,MY V KEEPS CHANGING,SSI-O,17

508,Yeah,SN-A,15
509,Did you now,SESU-P,11
510,6.67 mA current,SSI-O,17
511,it was like .00780487 or something,SSI-O,17
512,150,SSI-O,17
513,so circut 2 adjust the resistor till you get 4 on the multimeter and then circut 3 adjust till you get 4 on the multimeter i think,CP-S,7
514,I'm a little confuse with finding the voltage,SSI-U,19
515,p,SMC-O,13
516,3.9M but way 1V off,CMC-S,5
517,Mine is 2 V,SSI-O,17
518,4.03,SSI-O,17
519,and up our resistor values,CP-S,7
520,i can see it if you click on view all circuits at the top,SSI-T,18
521,just press the we got it once you do it,CMC-S,5
522,2.53 v and 270 ohm on 1,SSI-O,17
523,rip,SMC-O,13
524,maybe I should increase mine,SSI-O,17
525,3.1,SSI-O,17
526,ok so what if we all made our resistors 680,SESU-P,11
527,yeah,SN-A,15
528,we have to add all of them up,CRF-F,8
529,pot what's your resistor set to?,SESU-P,11

558,i'm back at 820,SSI-O,17
559,huh....,SESU-A,10
560,120 ohms,SSI-O,17
561,alright ready,SMC-O,13
562,"same, do we put in the E to start off with or are we trying to figure that out?",SESU-P,11
563,TRUE,SN-A,15
564,but we can't change r0,SN-D,16
565,If we break the connection and just hook the multimeters in series shouldn't that be the current for just R0?,SESU-P,11
566,thanks,SMC-R,14
567,"it should by like 560,680 or 820",CRF-F,8
568,??,SESU-P,11
569,is everyone's resistor at 10 ohms?,SESU-P,11
570,that what we were trying earlier. we should be able to calculate R0's v because amps should be the same throughout the circuit,CRF-F,8
571,Mine's 1.2,SSI-O,17
572,1.56,SSI-O,17
573,why can't we move forward?,SMC-O,13

579,Iowa got 128.7 ohm,SSI-O,17
580,one,SSI-O,17
581,I set the the nob on 20 DCV and i have 4.18,CEC-R,1
582,I think it should be 17 V,CRF-F,8
583,Wrong variable,SSI-U,19
584,nah nvm wrong number,SSI-U,19

596,RT = 617,SSI-O,17
597,ill stay put,CEC-R,1
598,oh,SESU-A,10
599,Peach you need 330,SSI-O,17
600,so then 390*0.012083=4.71237,SSI-O,17
601,im at 3.14,SSI-O,17
602,im at 120,SSI-O,17

620,to 390,CEC-S,2
621,and I need 2.81,SSI-O,17
622,Oh i forgot about R0,SSI-O,17
623,onward to the next page,SMC-O,13
624,Mine is at 1.08,SSI-O,17
625,by .0128,CP-S,7
1625,by .0128,CP-S,7
626,i think we just need to find a common resistor for each of the 3 places but im not entirely sure how to get there,CRF-F,8
627,"since R0 is 1000 Ohms and all our resistors are the same value, all our resistors are 1000 Ohms",SSI-O,17
628,hmmm,SESU-A,10
629,im R1,SSI-O,17
630,so that means the leftover 2.75 has to be dropping over R0 as well,SSI-O,17
631,Why cant you change it,SMC-O,13
632,2.75,SESU-A,10
634,i,SMC-O,13
635,we there yet?,CMC-S,5
636,im at 1.62V,SSI-O,17

638,Let's get this bread!,SMC-R,14
639,theres no 200,SSI-O,17
640,same,SESU-A,10
641,okay lets use our ohms law knowledge to figure this out,CP-S,7
642,good one,SMC-R,14
643,1.52+.69+6.91+n=9.12+n,SSI-O,17
644,mine said 12 was correct,CMC-S,5
645,i think you pull out the first lead from the circuit and connect the meter into that break,CP-S,7
646,same,SESU-A,10
647,1000,SSI-O,17
648,no bc total resistance is just added up between the three resistors,SN-D,16
649,nope,SN-D,16
650,bet,SESU-A,10
651,but thatll just give 4000,SN-D,16
652,180,SSI-O,17
653,we can try it,CP-S,7
654,hes checking his notes,SSI-O,17
655,i'm at 2.6 and 220,SSI-O,17
656,horn now just keep changing your resistance until you get to 4.25 V. It might work,CEC-R,1
657,Same,SESU-A,10
658,TigER,CMC-G,4
659,if so why?,SESU-P,11
660,im going to 140. that was my too high,CEC-R,1
661,Okay Grape i understand now,SSI-U,19
662,"Then R2, then R3 has the smaller resistance",SSI-O,17
663,V=Ir1+ir2+ir3,SSI-O,17
664,I think we're onto something,SSI-U,19
665,same,SESU-A,10
666,we should all have the same current,CRF-R,9
667,Upping your resistance decreases your voltage.,CRF-F,8
668,are we supposed to get an E value first?,SESU-P,11
669,yep,SN-A,15
670,I = 0.006,SSI-O,17
671,click on resistor and change the value if you want to,CP-S,7
672,3.97,SSI-O,17
673,The current is the same acrossed all the resistors when theyre in series,CRF-R,9
674,ya,SN-A,15
675,as the total current for the series circut,SESU-A,10
676,sigh,SMC-R,14
677,it's the same thing,SN-A,15
678,yes,SN-A,15
679,im at 3.09 again,SSI-O,17
680,5y3.y5,SMC-O,13
681,It didn,SSI-O,17
682,So 117.65/3 = 39.2 per resistor?,SESU-P,11
683,I get up to 4.77 volts,SSI-O,17
684,i did that,CEC-R,1
685,ok so the voltage drop from resistor 0 is,SSI-O,17
686,i think i got it,CMC-S,5
687,Everyones is 220 ohms,SSI-O,17
688,any ideas?,SESU-P,11
689,2.14,SSI-O,17
690,hmmm ok then sorry,SESU-A,10
691,what is the goal,SESU-P,11
692,ah,SESU-A,10
693,i am very upset,SMC-O,13
694,yiy,SMC-O,13
695,I fixed it,CEC-R,1
696,so our goal v/0.006 ma?,SESU-P,11
697,goal is 3.87,SSI-O,17
698,hahahaha same forreal,SESU-A,10
699,Bet,SESU-A,10
700,which is 0.154,SSI-O,17
701,how did you find that?,SESU-P,11
702,i will go 470,CEC-R,1
703,now 4.82,SSI-O,17
704,ik right,SESU-A,10
705,same,SESU-A,10
706,should be on DCV 20,SSI-O,17
707,Yeah I got no freakin clue as of yet,SSI-U,19
708,any other ideas,SESU-P,11
709,v=ir i guess,SSI-O,17
710,easy peasy,SMC-O,13
711,"Yeah, I got the same thing",SN-A,15
712,teamwork.,SMC-R,14
713,resistor,SSI-O,17
714,right?,SESU-P,11
715,Okay,SESU-A,10
716,do we have to be under 100omhs,SESU-P,11
717,would you find your R,CP-S,7
718,that would explain it,SESU-A,10
719,is everyone using DCV 20?,SESU-P,11
720,what do yo uguys get if you guys put those numbers in there?,SESU-P,11
721,thats the current,SSI-O,17
722,not .22,SN-D,16
723,what circuit is what,SESU-P,11
724,I'm still trying to solve this,CEC-R,1
725,im just decreasing the resistor,CEC-R,1
726,same..,SESU-A,10
727,ig,SMC-O,13
728,same,SESU-A,10
729,My resistor is now at 10 ohms.,SSI-O,17
730,okay sweet,SESU-A,10
731,reading 1.74,SSI-O,17
732,150 with 3.52,SSI-O,17
733,im close to my goal with a 330 ohm resistor (goal 2.2 at 2.14),CMC-S,5
734,eagle,CMC-G,4
735,and im confused too,SSI-U,19
736,pause,CEC-S,2
737,What are we supposed to do with that?,SESU-P,11
738,im .01,SSI-O,17
739,which resistor band have we been changing,SESU-P,11
740,like to start or when we were close,SESU-P,11
741,its saying 0 now,SSI-O,17
742,okay so if 1.45=120*I,CRF-F,8
743,that makes it go to 7.08 then drops to 6.85,SSI-O,17
744,"right, then use the amps we find there",SN-A,15
745,but how do we find it?,SESU-P,11
746,11-5.64-3.85=1.51,SSI-O,17
747,should all have same curretn in a series i thought,SSI-O,17
748,wait i just got it,CMC-S,5
749,"I thought i understood this, but now i am very confused",SSI-U,19
750,mine is 4.5,SSI-O,17
751,now mines automaticalyl gone up to 1.89 volts,SSI-O,17
752,I thought so too but I guess not,SESU-A,10
753,"sorry, your right",SN-A,15
754,1.04 with 180,SSI-O,17
755,ohm,SESU-A,10
756,im still off,CMC-S,5

758,no,SN-D,16
759,im close also at 270 ohm,CMC-S,5
760,1.65,SSI-O,17
761,I changed mine to 270?? and I am .02V off,CMC-S,5
762,E=8.13 V?,SESU-P,11
763,R= 850?,SESU-P,11
764,someone changed something now im a7 3.5,CP-G,6

766,3.42...,SSI-O,17
767,someone try upping the resistance by one step,CP-S,7
768,my goal is 1.95,SSI-O,17
769,Was,SSI-O,17
770,i guess for mine at least... do we all have the same values?,SESU-P,11
771,ie the original R value which I think was 6.8Kohms?,SESU-P,11
772,our current was the same v/r= 0.0035,SSI-O,17
773,uh I honestly have no clue what I havbe,SSI-U,19
774,4.5 V,SSI-O,17
775,yep,SN-A,15
776,I think you need to lower the resistance on yours,CP-S,7
777,mine is still reading 2.61,SSI-O,17
778,and yeah  valley youre right,SN-A,15
779,trying to calculate this shit,CEC-R,1
780,R3 at 390 ohms 7.7 on the meter and my goal is 7.47,SSI-O,17
781,i have no clue it didnt say,SSI-O,17
782,3.54,SSI-O,17
783,That's because each of our circuits affects the others. So when one changes they all change.,CRF-R,9
784,how,SESU-P,11
785,R0 = (E - 0.05)/ 0.123,SSI-O,17
786,just cant remember how to find that,SSI-U,19
787,mine says zero now and we all have the same setup,SSI-O,17
788,i have 1000 ohm too for R0,SSI-O,17
789,^^^^,SMC-R,14
790,we were close on getting 2,CMC-S,5
791,0.08 away,CMC-S,5
792,plus all our volts,SSI-O,17
793,ok,SESU-A,10
794,ROGER!?,SESU-A,10
795,I think we all have to change ours till each one of our voltmeters says 2.5 on it..,CP-G,6
796,what about now?,SESU-P,11
797,nope,SN-D,16
798,So like whats e,SESU-P,11
799,plum you good?,CMC-G,4
800,ok,SESU-A,10
801,list your target voltages please?,SESU-P,11
802,yee,SMC-R,14
803,ok ill go up,CEC-R,1
804,fuq,SMC-I,12
805,I really wish i could use paper,SMC-O,13
806,good,CMC-S,5
807,ok im at goal,CMC-S,5
808,I needa be at  3.51,SSI-O,17
809,so my r is 1000,SSI-O,17
810,im .01 off,CMC-S,5
811,First things first is put your R0 and goal voltage,SESU-P,11
812,OH shit we did it,CMC-S,5
813,pliers what voltage do you need,SESU-P,11
814,so  does yours randomly seem to change? like I got it on my goal but it shifts?,SESU-P,11
815,do we all have to click the we got it thing?,SESU-P,11
816,good work guys,SMC-R,14
817,there now,CEC-R,1
818,1.91 at 220,SSI-O,17
819,liar,SMC-I,12
820,im back my bad,SMC-O,13
821,1.82 volts,SSI-O,17
822,my r is 560,SSI-O,17
823,so multiply your resistance by 0.00599 to see if it matches your goal,CP-S,7
824,270,SSI-O,17
825,starting with 6v and we need to make 1.5v,CP-G,6
826,do you see that?,SESU-P,11
827,how to get the proper I eludes me,SSI-U,19
828,collie: so your multimeter is reading 470? or you mm is reading 80?,SESU-P,11
829,Later,SMC-R,14
830,nooo i need to go way higher than 150,SN-D,16
831,ive been doing that,CEC-R,1
832,yeah that works,SN-A,15
833,2.44 volts,SSI-O,17
834,"im 560, blue is 802 and green is 680",SSI-O,17
835,4.6,SSI-O,17
836,That means that R0 goal voltage is 5.98V.,SSI-O,17
837,how do we change the resistance on the resistor,SESU-P,11
838,Tiger?,CMC-G,4
839,Put your probes,CP-S,7
840,2 volts,SSI-O,17
841,5.48?,SESU-P,11
842,Ok,SESU-A,10
843,"it did that too me too, i just ha to wait alittle",SSI-O,17
844,did everyone enter the unknown value into the box?,CMC-G,4
845,bear,CMC-G,4
846,at 330,SSI-O,17
847,4.97 at 820,SSI-O,17
848,uj56trmk,SMC-O,13
849,lol,SMC-R,14
850,What if we tried that?,SESU-P,11
851,this one should work,CRF-F,8
852,This is hard,SSI-U,19
853,ok,SESU-A,10
854,my goal is 2.75,SSI-O,17
855,Maybe it needs E,CRF-F,8
856,1.54 volts,SSI-O,17
857,idk what to do,SSI-U,19
858,Forgot to subtract,SN-D,16
859,now im at 4.12,SSI-O,17
860,cus thats thousands,SSI-O,17
861,im good,SESU-A,10
862,okay okay,SESU-A,10
863,4.75,SSI-O,17
864,no,SN-D,16
865,what does your guys voltage have to be,SESU-P,11
866,was it important?,SMC-O,13
867,ayye what up,SMC-R,14
868,my goal is 2.25 volts,SSI-O,17
869,ima do my best but this stuff tough tbh,SSI-U,19
870,it worked,CMC-S,5
871,and do 20v,CP-S,7
872,our nubmers changed :'(,SSI-O,17
873,whats everyone set at,SESU-P,11
874,4.5 here,SSI-O,17
875,now I'm up at 6.8V,SSI-O,17
876,because that is current right?,SESU-P,11
877,i need to use paper...,SMC-O,13
878,way over,CMC-S,5
879,drop yours one down,CP-S,7
880,Not 1.5 ;but close,CMC-S,5
881,mine went to 2.45,SSI-O,17
882,copy that,SESU-A,10
883,click \,CP-S,7
884,.08 too high,CMC-S,5
885,Yeah mine moves on its own as well,SN-A,15
886,im at 270,SSI-O,17
887,ok,SESU-A,10
888,my thing at the top says 330 but when i measure it its 46.3? idk why,SESU-P,11
889,1 lower,SESU-A,10
890,Like when we went to 150 could you change it,SMC-O,13
891,right now I'm going to keep mine at 1k,CEC-R,1
892,3.81,SSI-O,17
893,I read 3.33 V. From R3,SSI-O,17
894,yeah mine just went down again,SN-A,15
895,well good work yall,SMC-R,14
896,15 v,SSI-O,17
897,yeee 3.25,SN-A,15
898,same,SESU-A,10
899,just set it to  390,CMC-G,4
900,green whats your goal?,SESU-P,11
901,2.43,SSI-O,17
902,one of you will hve to change,SSI-O,17
903,5.37,SSI-O,17
904,spaniel go down to 680,CEC-S,2
905,hmmm my voltage still too lower,CMC-S,5
906,ok,SESU-A,10
907,any other ideas?,SESU-P,11
908,Mine is right rn,CMC-S,5
909,I'm R1 680,SSI-O,17
910,do yall know what setting to put the meter on to see the resultant current?,SESU-P,11
911,im at 270 with 2.47,SSI-O,17
912,or make it 680,CP-S,7
913,im at .67 v at 150 resistance,SSI-O,17
914,"I did not, I think she will give us an extension",SMC-O,13
915,"yes, im reading 2.75 v",SN-A,15
916,at 2.32,SSI-O,17
917,I think we need to use current to solve this. Mine is 18.6 amps,CP-S,7
918,wher the hell are you,CMC-G,4
919,i have it exactly now,CMC-S,5
920,everyone write down whatever resistance they have right now to remeber it,SESU-P,11
921,ya meter doesnt show that very well,SN-A,15
922,i'm at 560,SSI-O,17
923,Did you break your circuit to measure amps?,SESU-P,11
924,6.5 on meter,SSI-O,17
925,now im at 8.42,SSI-O,17
926,3.27 v,SSI-O,17
927,only two units to choose from,SSI-O,17
928,2.66 volts,SSI-O,17
929,0.78/10=I,SSI-O,17
930,what step r u confused on? did u get how we got the current?,SESU-P,11
931,"ah well, it was worth a shot",SMC-R,14
932,i'm calculating around 150 ohms,CEC-R,1
933,.67 off by .04,CMC-S,5
934,1.76 now,SSI-O,17
935,1.69,SSI-O,17
936,done,CMC-S,5
937,Was literally typing out if we guess and check enough we will get it hahahha,CP-S,7
938,"so, we can figure out the voltage of R0",SSI-O,17
939,No,SN-D,16
940,going down one more,CEC-R,1
941,it is reading 22 for me at 200 k and 1 at 20 k,SSI-O,17
942,no,SN-D,16
943,I'm reading 5.33 V when I should have 5.35 V,CMC-S,5
944,Oh wait i'm the first resistor in the circuit,SSI-O,17
945,hmmmmmmm,SSI-U,19
946,pineapple,SMC-O,13
947,yeah,SN-A,15
948,59i0,SMC-O,13
949,well he dont even know,SSI-O,17
950,my goal is 4.5V,SSI-O,17
951,ape,SMC-I,12
952,"I'm 6.38A,  3.73 volts",SSI-O,17
953,mine too,SESU-A,10
954,im at 6.45 now,SSI-O,17
955,yes,SN-A,15
956,0.57,SSI-O,17
957,So R1 goes first and sets it right?,SESU-P,11
958,"So, are we controlling the amperage?",SESU-P,11
959,180,SSI-O,17
960,2,SSI-O,17
961,yeah,SN-A,15
962,seagull go 560,CEC-S,2
963,ill go up to 68,CEC-R,1
964,to get the voltage drop for R0,SESU-A,10
965,ice cream go to 150,CEC-S,2
966,And i need 5.71,SSI-O,17
967,meter isnt reading now,SSI-O,17
968,2=(.05333*Req+Req),SSI-O,17
969,some one changed that,SSI-O,17
970,bear the resistor too,SSI-O,17
971,we each indivdually have our own R0,SSI-O,17
972,true i agree with that,SN-A,15
973,I was just at 4.13,SSI-O,17
974,someone has cut the wire,CMC-G,4
975,"ok, i think i need a 220 ohm resistor. putting it in.",CEC-R,1
976,but 17v is right for e,CMC-S,5
977,and i got 1.67,SSI-O,17
978,drop it to 120,CEC-S,2
979,Same,SESU-A,10
980,3.44,SSI-O,17
981,I believe it is 12/390 assuming E=IR,SSI-O,17
982,im falling asleep,SMC-O,13
983,the odd one out removes the wires from the bread board and measures the voltage,CP-S,7
984,ok,SESU-A,10
985,390,SSI-O,17
986,3.5 also,CMC-S,5
987,4.7 is my goal,SSI-O,17
988,yeah,SN-A,15
989,acton?,CMC-G,4
990,yea,SN-A,15
991,4.25,SESU-A,10
992,9,SSI-O,17
993,are your things on the outside of the resistor or somewhere else,SESU-P,11
994,yea,SN-A,15
995,yes,SN-A,15
996,"so who can read the amps, I think they are wrong",SESU-P,11
997,put your R to 820,CP-S,7
