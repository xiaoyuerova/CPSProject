12876,51124,560,SSI-O
5556,43799,does it have to be exact,SESU-P
4539,42780,Okay,SESU-A
4802,43043,i mean voltage,SESU-A
2019,31214,"that brought me closer, but still high, is triangle still low?",CMC-S
9724,47967,Now its not working,SN-D
9112,47355,yea we can change it back but how else would we find the voltage for R0?,SN-A
4311,42552,v,SESU-A
3322,41558,let's try to find ones below 1k,CP-S
13339,51587,2.83,SSI-O
412,413,thats what i have selected,CEC-R
15208,53460,1.07,SSI-O
13332,51580,680,SSI-O
463,465,I just changed to 390 ohm,CEC-R
5118,43359,goal,SESU-A
917,920,"Green, can you lower yours?",CEC-S
5956,44199,eagle whats your resistor value,SESU-P
1643,30837,.01 off,CMC-S
8848,47091,i am now,SN-A
7081,45324,What are we supposed to do with that?,SESU-P
7047,45290,What did you find your E to be?,SESU-P
980,983,"Baked, go to 180",CEC-S
5456,43699,what is yours?,SESU-P
10345,48592,ok when i do that it now says -3.99,SSI-O
1644,30838,.02 away at 1.2 a sec ago,CMC-S
5485,43728,ok what after that?,SESU-P
9196,47439,ya,SN-A
5695,43938,wanna try 680?,SESU-P
4986,43227,same,SESU-A
11361,49608,But that needs to change for each one too,SSI-O
15315,53567,No organization what so ever,SSI-O
14417,52667,at 4.69 v,SSI-O
2990,41226,we gotta make 2 equations,CP-S
14625,52875,I have 2.43 V,SSI-O
15490,53745,2.05 volts at 330 ohms,SSI-T
11516,49763,i have a voltage drop of 2.28 v,SSI-O
15139,53391,1.79 now,SSI-O
9385,47628,yeah haha,SN-A
11686,49933,I have 3.48v as well,SSI-O
13579,51827,10.75,SSI-O
11263,49510,at -5.74 V,SSI-O
13086,51334,7.08 right now,SSI-O
8915,47158,yeah?,SN-A
6924,45167,poods what are your readings,SESU-P
9160,47403,yeah try that,SN-A
8180,46423,it k,SMC-R
5084,43325,rn,SESU-A
14563,52813,so the current in the circuit is 0.036 amps,SSI-O
13932,52180,im at 150,SSI-O
7551,45794,y,SMC-O
3125,41361,we can measure the voltage drop with the multimeter,CP-S
3629,41870,ok so all resistors shoul dbe 390 ohms,CRF-F
12570,50817,5.93,SSI-O
15708,53963,i dont remember,SSI-U
15322,53574,I thoguth it was 560n680 and 820,SSI-O
9003,47246,Yes,SN-A
5284,43527,now its 2.0 right?,SESU-P
2554,33704,gj,CM-G
6652,44895,and concord what do you have,SESU-P
3646,41887,because if yours changes the others do,CRF-F
2525,31720,I think we all are good. I saw that Utah had the unknown value,CMC-S
2697,40932,we still have to find E,CP-G
13821,52069,1.78,SSI-O
5559,43802,how do you change R,SESU-P
12479,50726,resistor at 180,SSI-O
10041,48288,But I get1.59,SSI-O
206,207,i will,CEC-R
1103,1106,"im as close as i can go, peach your turn",CEC-S
11143,49390,I cant get mine it gets close but not there,SSI-O
11478,49725,cuz my V1 is 4.07V,SSI-O
9860,48107,2.75,SSI-O
5361,43604,what voltage does everyone need?,SESU-P
10054,48301,Current stay the same,SSI-O
13646,51894,the sum of what we just put,SSI-O
12962,51210,At 0.03V now,SSI-O
9137,47380,yeah same!,SN-A
4369,42610,same,SESU-A
6939,45182,What are you goal voltages?,SESU-P
1280,1283,celery try changing your r and seeing if you get anything,CEC-S
10715,48962,the red part,SSI-O
13252,51500,i got 5.48,SSI-O
3268,41504,other way other way,CP-S
2367,31562,.01 away,CMC-S
7875,46118,I was not prepared for class today. lol,SMC-O
7344,45587,B========D,SMC-I
12536,50783,okay 2.12 this time,SSI-O
5412,43655,"my resistance was at 180 for the last one, what were you guys at",SESU-P
10935,49182,I read 3.33 V. From R3,SSI-O
1516,30709,both of you,CMC-G
2404,31599,closer,CMC-S
7112,45355,I think it's just using the DMM right?,SESU-P
7716,45959,can we leave?,SMC-O
15111,53363,cuz E is jus our 4 voltages added up,SSI-O
3928,42169,All of our resistors added up give R0,CRF-R
6965,45208,now what,SESU-P
14824,53074,i'm at 330,SSI-O
9056,47299,that works better for me,SN-A
12676,50924,wait my voltage isn't the same anymore,SSI-O
14784,53034,820,SSI-O
11020,49267,check this:,SSI-O
