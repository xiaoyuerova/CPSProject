performed 15/4 with 3.75,6
well we have 4 R,4
I think the voltage is different tho?,0
15/4 is 3.75 not,3
no?,0
E is 15 volts for me aswell,3
just make our resistor all 390,5

changed r2 from 820 to 390 via change,6
changed r2 from 390 to 390 via change,6
changed r3 from 330 to 390 via change,6
changed r3 from 390 to 390 via change,6
Yup,2
got 3.75,10
hey it worked!,10
yep,2
Cool,1
next one,1
clicked submit,7
2.79,3
3.36v,3
.71V,3
OK now things are interesting,0
lets add them up see what we are missing?,0
So iR0 is equal to 1 kOhm,3
performed 2.79+3.366+.71 with 6.866,6
My DCV is currently at 20,3
performed 14-6.86 with 7.14,6
changed r3 from 680 to 47000 via change,6
changed r3 from 47000 to 47000 via change,6
changed r3 from 47000 to 12 via change,6
changed r3 from 12 to 12 via change,6
changed r3 from 12 to 10 via change,6
changed r3 from 10 to 10 via change,6
so our voltages are total 6.8,3
changed r3 from 10 to 12 via change,6
changed r3 from 12 to 12 via change,6
which leaves 7.2 for the R0,3
"Let's all say what our DCV is at, it will make our lives easier",0
If it's at 7.2 for R0 it means the current is 7.2mA throughout the circuit,4
sounds right to me,2
OK,0
Since I1=IT,3
So it would be 7.2mA times our unknown resistance to get our given voltage,3
performed 7.2/1000 with 0.0072,6
performed 0.0072 with 0.0072,6
no,2
our voltage and current to get R,2
performed .71/.0072 with 98.61111111,6
Yeah,2
it's the same thing,2
I have an idea for an alternate way to solve this conundrum if you willing for a little trial and error,3
R=V/I or V= IR,3
May I pitch my idea?,0
go for it,9
performed 3.36/.0072 with 466.6666667,6
changed r1 from 820 to 470 via change,6
changed r1 from 470 to 470 via change,6
"ok so we Know I need the highest voltage, Pencil need the medium and paper has the lowest voltage required correct?",0
yeah,2
so my res is going to be the lowest of the 3,4
changed r3 from 12 to 18 via change,6
changed r3 from 18 to 18 via change,6
changed r3 from 18 to 47 via change,6
changed r3 from 47 to 47 via change,6
performed 3.36/.0072 with 466.6666667,6
changed r3 from 47 to 100 via change,6
changed r3 from 100 to 100 via change,6
Voltage divider rule,3
changed r3 from 100 to 82 via change,6
changed r3 from 82 to 82 via change,6
so since paper is lowest they need the highest resistance,4
yeah i already set mine to 470,2
given earliers fiddlings ive deduced that we can't go lower than 20 DCV,4
changed r3 from 82 to 100 via change,6
changed r3 from 100 to 100 via change,6
my answer was 466.666 and that was the closest available,3
changed r3 from 100 to 82 via change,6

changed r1 from 470 to 470 via change,6
what if I lowered my DVC to 2000m?,0
we could experiment with the higher resistances then,5
I think the DCV just changes the scale correct?,0
like moving the decimal forward or back,0
I don't exactly know,3
"yes it sets to milli, kilo mega etc",2
Ah,0
The tutorial wasn't very clear and i've never seen a multi meter like this before,3
I apologise,1
it's cool,1
lol,1
performed 2.79/3.36 with 0.830357143,6

give me a sec I think i'm doing my math wrong,9
word,1
performed .71/.0072 with 98.61111111,6
"btw, setting the multimeter sets the voltage to its correct decimal place",3
To 20 volts I mean,3
"since we have 14, if that makes sense",3

where do you think you're messing up?,0
because I know E= IxR,3
Do you know what your resistance is supposed to be,0
R=V/I is the formula I used but it's the same thing,9
performed .71/.0072 with 98.61111111,6
and earlier you said I was 7.2 yeah?,0

not rounded it's like,3
.00714 A,3
oh,0
also sorry im screwing this up,1
yes but it should get you close enough to the values given to us,2
ok,0
Yeah it shouldn't really matter too much,2
we're given all values after all,3
true true,2
Its fine but Pen is your r set now? i think we should just submit the answers,0
I'm not sure,3

But try using that resistance to calculate current,5

performed 47*1000 with 47000,6
performed 3.49/47000 with 7.43E-05,6
this number is way too small,3
Well shoot,1
what is it?,0
0.00007425,3
Definitely too small,2
maybe because our resistors are so high,4
im at 33k,3

lets work back down and who ever gets their voltage first,5
find their current,5

so R0 = 120,3
mine is 100,3
ah,0
okay so our total resistance rn is 440,3
ok,0

8.43 volts,3
nope not it,2
we need to enter the Total volts for the entire circuit at the bottom right,0
so we need r0 value right,0
no we need just E,2
with our voltage we have 8.43,3
R0 is 820 ohms,3
right,2
everyone has their goal correct right?,0
yep,2
What is your resistance set at? We have to figure out voltage total,5

im out,1
alright,0
hey!!!,1
hi,1
hey,1
What is your goal??,0
to make the voltage 2 volts,3
"Mine was set E= 8 volts, R0=120 and the goal is 2 volts",3
same here,0
same,0
Im confused on how to use the machine on the side on how to read it,3
I dont even know whats happening here :p,3

resistor is 2.2k and multimeter is set at 20k reading 2.20,3

hey so I just go in here and I have my voltage at 4.5 do I just press (we got it) ?,10
no,2
you have to adjust your resistor to make your voltage to be 4.5,9
what do I do next,0
have you seen our chat history?,0
we figured out the current I is 0.0375,3
then use your goal voltage to divide the current I,9

yes thats the answer,2
we have to alter our individual resistors,5
what the hell,3
put it at 150,5
150 is not the answer,2
this is so irritating,1
clicked submit,7
that's where we start at,3
150 is def not the answer,2
tiger just get yours at 3.25,9
and then let us know,9
so that bear can then get theirs at 3.25,5
and then finally me,5
yes that way we can adjust accordingly,2

what exactly are we trying to do here,0
"yes, so are we setting the meter to 1k or what? i dont see a 1K setting",2
get whataever volts it says at top,5
your goal,0
throw ur leads on resistor,5
it should show a voltage,3
what volts are you talking about,0
I dont see anything above,3
look under we got it!,3
should show E = 18 volts,3
r0 = 120,3
your goal,3
and also said the goal is to make the voltage to 4.5,3
my resistor is 1.83 volts,3
two 4.5 volts,3
mine is 4.5,3
changed r2 from 820 to 1800 via change,6

and yours is 1.83?,0
its not even?,0
mine says 4.5,3

my goal is 4.5,3
k so all our resistors are the same,3
it will be the same,0

no idea what im doing,3
me either,0
changed r1 from 270 to 270 via change,8
look at the top above the picture. it says E total and R0 and then your goal voltage. what does it say for the goal voltage,0
goal is 4.5v,3
4.5,3
changed r1 from 270 to 12 via change,8
changed r1 from 12 to 100 via change,8
so we all have 4.5,3
changed r1 from 100 to 150 via change,8
Et is 18 Volt,3
changed r1 from 150 to 270 via change,8
performed 4.5*3 with 13.5,6
changed r1 from 270 to 390 via change,6
"if we add up all our goal volts, it adds up to 13.5",3
we subtract 13.5 from 18,3
and get 4.5,3
that 4.5 is R0,3
so what does that mean?,0
changed r1 from 390 to 18000 via change,6
so every resistor in this circuit has a voltage of 4.5,3
changed r1 from 18000 to 4700 via change,6

performed 18/4.5 with 4,6
changed r1 from 1000 to 820 via change,6
changed r1 from 820 to 680 via change,6
i mean i get that but what do need to do?,0
"since R0 is 1000 Ohms and all our resistors are the same value, all our resistors are 1000 Ohms",3
i think we need to find the resistance for all our resistors,5
thats my guess,3

we did all our math right so probs a concept mistake?,0
yeah maybe,2
check this:,3
okay,0
i like double checked everyone's math and got the same answers,3
are we all suppose to be at 180?,0
so we add all our voltages required and subtract it from 11V(total EMF). then we divided that Voltage with 330 ohms and that's the correct current of the circuit,5
does that sound right?,0
ohhh dang ya makes sense,2
adding the voltages is like doing a kirchoff,4

someone want to try to measure it?  i think that might work by breaking the ciruit,10
performed -0.009814815 with -0.009814815,6
if you break it between the green wire and the resistor and put the probes in between,4
mind if i try?,0
0.009814814814814816=I,3
I just measured 7.41 Amp,3
want to double check it by calculating it?,0
Sure but how will we do that?,2
that is what i did,3
if we add R0 R1 R2 and R3 we know the battery voltage so we can solve for I,4
V=IR,3
So dont we have to report our R's on our resistors,3
How did you know the value of my resistor?,0
v on r0 is 2.65,3
nice,1
good call,0

okay.  now what?,0
Wont that current just change though if we change the resistance,4
i don't think so,2
this is at the indicated values for v,3

So now how do we do this,0
well we can't change v or r0,5
Originally i thought we could subtract all the voltages we know as our goals and then we would have some left over value,5
performed 3.25/0.009814814814814816 with 331.1320755,6
that value would equal the voltage in R0,4
yup,2
And then we could find the current using V=IR0,3
changed r3 from 390 to 330 via change,6
changed r3 from 330 to 330 via change,6
And then since current is the same in series we could all just do V=IR knowing V from the problem and I from that solvr,3

so i was saying we know v= 15. we know amps is 2.2. we need to solve the equation:,5
"No, R0 is 680",2
We need our VOLTAGE to be 3.75,5
15 = (2.2)(680 + R1 + r2 + r3),3
I agree with Bear,2

performed 0.89/820 with 0.001085366,6
performed 4.07/820 with 0.004963415,6
so I=0.00109,3
so I = 0.005,3
cuz my V1 is 4.07V,3
i lied dont listen to me,3
performed 2.94/.005 with 588,6
changed r2 from 330 to 560 via change,6
changed r2 from 560 to 560 via change,6
lol,1
"red, you still alive?",0
yeah,2
changed r3 from 1000 to 1200 via change,6
changed r3 from 1200 to 1200 via change,6
so you can try to use I = 0.005Amp,5
performed 4.99/.005 with 998,6
when i did 2.94/0.005 i got 588,3
performed 470*0.005 with 2.35,6
changed r3 from 1200 to 1000 via change,6
changed r3 from 1000 to 1000 via change,6
so the closest is 560,3
V0= 2.35V,3
i should be around 1k ohms,3

yo,1
try E = 10.57V,5
performed 10.57/.005 with 2114,6
nvm,3
wrong,2
it is correct at 13V,10
ok move on!,5
performed 13/0.005 with 2600,6
can we?,0
no...,2
i think we still have to get to the correct voltage of each resistor,4
i think something might be wrong with greens that it cant change cause i dont see a way this can work with green at 820,3
so we is the situation,3
performed 13/820 with 0.015853659,6
yeah we need to get the correct voltage,2
"my resistance is set. therefore, my voltage drop is set",3
yeah,2
also,0
current is constant,3
current would have to be 0.0159 for green to have 820,4
then you guys have to change your R,5
so that mine drop to 0.89V,3

is the 3.5v goal to make our 3 resistors add up to a 3.5 v drop?,0

So are we supposed to make our voltage drops 3.5 or are we supposed to change the source voltage?,0

what volts does it ask you for?,0
2.75,3
performed 2.75/11 with 0.25,6
ok cool. According to the voltage equation the ratio of (R/RT) needs to be 1/4,3
2.75=11(R/RT),3
from that ^,3
performed 2.75/11 with 0.25,6
0.25,3
"1/4, got it",3
"so we all have to get the right R (numerator value) so that when we add them up, our chosen value of each of them over the total equals .25",5
got it,0
so  R0 is our total resistance right?,0
performed 820+180+220+100 with 1320,6
"no R0 is the first resistor which is 820, should be at the top of your screen",2

correct,2

so we know R/Rt must equal 1/4. so how do we coordinate this? do we just pick a random Rt and figure out the R from there?,0

no i think if our voltages all need to be 2.75 if we times that by 3 we get 8.25,2
performed 11-8.25 with 2.75,6
performed 11/820 with 0.013414634,6
so that means the leftover 2.75 has to be dropping over R0 as well,3

doesn't the voltage drop to 0 at the end of the circuit,0
Yeah,2
performed 330*0.024 with 7.92,6
i think the 0.024 is the current not the voltage drop i think voltage drop for R0 is 0.08 because if you take 0.024 as current and 330 for the resistance and multiply them you get 7.92 and subtract the original voltage 8 a difference of 0.08 so wouldnt that be the volt drop???,0

performed 11/100 with 0.11,6
changed r1 from 330 to 560 via change,6
11volts/100 = .11amps for the R0,3
my voltage is 1.45,3
okay so use .11 for the current?,0
performed 3.85/.11 with 35,6
opened zoom,7
yes,2
"no, because 11 volts isnt across r0",2
all ouf our voltages add up to 11 right?,0
V at r0 = 11 - each of our measured voltage,3
yes,2
"right, after r0 the voltage drops",2
performed 11-3.85-5.64-.83 with 0.68,6
so its voltage is .68,3
how did you find that?,0
performed 11/100 with 0.11,6
performed 0.11*11 with 1.21,6
you said your voltage is 5.64 and .83 and mine is 3.85 so couldnt we just add all of those up and subtract from 11,0

im confused lol,3
mine is at 3.99 volts,3
11-5.64-3.85=1.51,3
opened zoom,7
but theres also the .83,3
A less volatile way imo is to add our resistances and R0,5
then we do V/R to find total circuit current,5
performed 1.51-.83 with 0.68,6
performed 0.68/100 with 0.0068,6
ok so r0 is 100ohms and my resistance (currently) is 150 ohm,3
performed 3.85/.0068 with 566.1764706,6
my resistance is 330,3
I think my resistance needs to be 560ohms which puts me at 3.99 volts,3
opened zoom,7
changed r1 from 330 to 560 via change,6
sorry at 5.4 V,3
make sure everyone leaves resistance where it is,10
im going to leave mine at 560 ohms and 5.4 for now,9
ok cool,0
performed 560+100+330+150 with 1140,6
560 + 100 + 330 + 150 = 1140,3

performed 11/1140 with 0.009649123,6
performed 11/1140 with 0.009649123,6
now 11/1140 = 0.00965 A,3
yes,2
Now if we take 0.00965 * R0 (which is 100) we will get the voltage drop across R0,4

so .965 volts dropped so 11-that will be where my voltage is at?,0

how many volts do you need to drop again?,0
"if lion meets the voltage goal then i can do mine, since im 2nd in line",4
that sounds good,0
my foal voltage is 3.85,3

ok so V=RI,3
so we can rearrange that to R = V/I,3
so 3.85/.00965?,0

performed 10.035-3.85 with 6.185,6
performed 3.85/.00965 with 398.9637306,6
okay so that gave me 398 but the closest resistance to choose from in 390 so i chose that and my meter is now reading 4.42,9
Im not 100% this will work btw :),3
well im trusting you,1
shieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeet,1
you got this buddy <3,1
"ok aweseome, so now since lion got theres, i can get mine",9
"the problem is, as soon as one of us changes resistance, the whole current changes",2
opened zoom,7
righty,2
hmm well i wont touch anything,9
so the I we are using doesnt work for subsequent calculations,3
"ok , so how about each of us get our voltages one at a time?",0
and just get as close as possible,5
opened zoom,7
"the problem with that is as soon as we change our resistance, the voltages for everybody else will change too",2
TRUE,2
thats why i was saying we should use the 11-3.85-.83-5.64 and then would have their voltage and then just take that voltage and divide it by their resistance which is 100,5
ok,0
performed 11-3.85-.83-5.64 with 0.68,6
performed 0.6800000000000006/100 with 0.0068,6
so doing that you are finding voltage over R0 right?,0
opened zoom,7
performed 11-3.85-.83-5.64 with 0.68,6
yeah and then it would be .68V=100omhs*Current,2
true i agree with that,2
and then the current ends up being  .0068,3
ok so current for everyone is .0068 then?,0
so im going to use that as my current and change my resistance now and then i will tell you my voltage,9
ok,0
"but when one of us changes our resistance to get our voltage drop, that current will change from .0068 right?",0
performed 3.85/.0068 with 566.1764706,6

performed 1.21-11 with -9.79,6
current only changes if the total resistance changes,3
performed 3.85/330 with 0.011666667,6
so 11v/100 ohm= .11amps then .11 amps * 11volts to get volt drop right? which would be 1.21 volts .... so 11v-1.21v =9.79volts after r0... so from 9.79volts to lions goal voltage,0
so lions meter is reading 4.42 volts right?,0

R0 is 220,3
How,0
do we add up the resistances? or something?,0
did you figure that out?,0
Thats the resistance 220 ohms,3
the R0 is listed in know info,3
oh duh lol,0
What are the R values we got,0

my brain is fried... excuse the pun but what do we do with that ohms number?,0
we have the total but what does that mean?,0
Im assuming V=I/R,4
hmm but dont we need I the current?,0
I guess we could find that out,5
The current is the same acrossed all the resistors when theyre in series,4
performed 10.18/1000 with 0.01018,6

why the extra 220ohms? its included in the 1670 total,0
performed 1000/10.18 with 98.23182711,6
wait,9
14.76V is the total drop that we know. The voltage drop across R0 is I(220). and yes I is constant,2
ok,0
the total voltage is equal to the total resistance (1670) times current (I),3
So we solve for I and then take I times Rt (total resistance),3

nope,2
sigh,1
mmmmm,0
hmmm,0
what are we doing wrong,0
Idk,3
lets start from the beginning: what is everyone's resistances,0
180,3
I tried: total R x I,9
1000,3
baked?,10
270; and R0 is 220,3
performed 180+1000+220+270 with 1670,6
performed 1000+270+220+180 with 1670,6
performed 180+1000+270+220 with 1670,6
180+1000+270+220=1670 ohms,3
yep,2
Voltage drops?,0
wouldnt that just be our measured voltage acrossed the resistor?,0
yes,2
wait,9
my voltage drop is 2.75 V,3

performed 1.83+2.75+1.18 with 5.76,6
performed 2.75+1.83+10.18 with 14.76,6
the v for r0 would be 2.2396?,0
performed 1.83+2.75+10.18 with 14.76,6
2.75+1.83+10.18= 14.76 V for know voltage drops,3
performed 2.2396+2.75+1.83+10.18 with 16.9996,6
ok im confused,3
then our total voltage drop would be 14.76 V + voltage drop across R0,3
performed 1670-220 with 1450,6
should be,4
performed 14.76/1450 with 0.01017931,6
Voltage drop across R0 = current (I) x 220 ohms,3
I just did that ... and the answer is 16.9996 which is a no go still,2
round it to 17,5
we did that as well,2
and it didnt work,3
it worked for me,3

what you got baked i guess you divide 12V by 680 to get current,0
i didnt,2
yes,2
how'd you get .0079?,0
what did you do?,0
i did 12- all of the other voltage drops we need,9

ok voltage drop across R0 is 1.71V,3
okay so e is 14 minus 4.44 minus 2.5 minus 5.35 divided by r0 gives us current,3

hamster?,10
it's not reading anything,3
i have my leads on opp ends of the resistor but it still says 0,3
make sure you see the wire highlight blue when you set the probe on,10
oh nvm i figured it out they looked like they were attached but the program didn't pick up on it,3
mine says 2.01,3
is the multimeter at the right setting,0
bump your resistance up to 330 and we can go from there,5

390,3
560 and im at 6.37,3
im at 4.44,3
performed 6.37/560 with 0.011375,6
okay im stuck but does anyone know how to apply the algebra formulas we used last class to finding two unknown variables?,0
what is your resistance and voltage currently,0
she gave me the formula E = I x R0 + I x R1 + I x R2 + I x R3,3
im at 100 ohms with 1.14 volts,3
mine is the same,0
i got .0114 for the current,3
performed 6.45/.0114 with 565.7894737,6
and when I plugged that in I got E = .0114 x R0 + 11.97,3

i got 6.21V for R0,3
wait my voltage isn't the same anymore,3
performed 9.34+6.21 with 15.55,6

did someone change their resistor value,0
did anyone change anything,0
yea i changed it to 1K to see the R0 value,2
is that not what we should do?,0

is it one of the formulas?,0
im assuming we need to use formulas,5
just need to figure out how,3
I'm just confused on where we get the value of I,3
isnt the current always the same throughout the circuit,0
"yeah, but what is it. like which number would that be on the top",2
try using the numbers that we found individually because if I is the same throughout the circuit we should all get the same answer,5
maybe we do 1.56 = I x R0 and solve for I,3
performed 1.56/1000 with 0.00156,6
thats really small number tho,3
"and what is Ro, 1000 ohm or 6.21V?",0
ohm,3
i have 1000 ohm too for R0,3
performed 1.9/1000 with 0.0019,6
the 6.21V i got when i changed the resistor to 1000 and read the meter,3
then I get.0019 and i dont think that is right,3
do we just do V=IR to find I,0
yea i get .00156 which doesnt seem right,2
thats what we just tried,3
you think 6.21 is right?,0
i dont know,3
oh i guess not because its not R0,3
that im changing the value of,9
ugh we just need I we have all the resistor values,5
what are everyone's resistor values? caue maybe we add all the values up and multiply that by I to get it,0
yea that is but we dont know I,2
mines 180 ohms,3
680,3
Do we have the voltage?,0
mine is 220,3
then maybe we divide all the resistor values by the voltage to get I,9
we dont know the voltage do we,0
performed 1000+180+680+120 with 1980,6
we know the voltage of R1 + R2 + R3,3
is that just adding up all of our voltages together?,0
performed 1.56/180 with 0.008666667,6
performed 1980/9.34 with 211.9914347,6

then solve for I,9
performed 5.88/680 with 0.008647059,6
performed 9.34/1980 with 0.004717172,6
performed 1.56/180 with 0.008666667,6
everyone try doing I=V/R with the numbers from your own circuit,5
performed 1.9/220 with 0.008636364,6
see if you get .0086470,5
so for me 1.56V = I x 180ohms then I = 0.00867,3
ah close,10
okay sweet,0
so thats I,3
but we didnt get the same exact?,0
I got 1.9V=Ix220ohm and got .008636,3
okay lets go with 0.0086?,0
ya,2
so V=8.63 for R0,3
or 8.6,3
to find E we add up all the resistance and multiply it by I right?,0
yeah,2
performed 8.6*1980 with 17028,6
wait how did you get V = 8.6 for R0,0
V=IR and R=1000                                              1000X.0086=8.6 V,3
ohh,0
so add that to 9.34V,3
right?,0

performed 17.939999999999998*0.0086 with 0.154284,6
should be 17.94,4
no thats just adding up the resistance values i think,2
so then multiply that times I,3
which is 0.154,3
which doesnt seem right,2
performed 1980*0.154 with 304.92,6
oh wait maybe it is 17.94,3
E=V0+V1+V2+V3,3
oh yea right,2
"oh, I mean lets try it and see if we get it right",5
it said that in the intro video,3
yea i think thats right,2
can we check,0
nope,2

we cant?,0
its not right,2

im good,10
hey Utah did you answer 17?,10
ye,2

when it says your goal is to make your voltage something,3
yeah,2
yeha but the reading isnt a number in the resistor,2
idk what is right value but i am just trying to calculate it so that we have rough value,9

has everyone got the correct box at the bottom,10
you bet,2

did you put it as volts or ohms?,0
volts,0
Maybe E is the resistance all added up? But i could have sworn is E is the battery it should be in volts,0
"yeah, it says mine is incorrect too",2
We can try adding up all the resistances,5

okay when changing my resistor to the 270 Ohms they use in the internal resistor (R0) I read 2.93V. Everything added up I got a total of 18.79V across all resistors and 1630 Ohms across all resistors. But that is before calculating current with I=V/R,3

performed 11.53*1630 with 18793.9,6
I think it's our best shot right now. I have no idea how else we would calculate it,4
But E would be in volts right? So what value would we submit? 18.79V?,0
Let's try it!,5
still says its wrong,10
It's still not right,10
it didn't work,10
Everyone's resistor reading is still correct yes?,10
Yes,2
yes,2
cant we use the multimeter to determine the current?,0
Current would be in Amps so yes i believe so,2
the current should be the same throughout the whole circuit,4
yes,2

We should divide our voltage goal by the resistor value we have to find the current that is the same throughout the circuit. Then plug in E=IxR0 + IxR1 + IxR2 + xR3. because then we will have the same I value across the whole circuit to use,5
"Wait guys, for your resistor, calculate what you get for V1/R1 or V3/R3.",5
and then we should be able to get E if our math is correct,5

what is it,0
what did you plug in/what formula,0
E=IxR0+V1+V2+V3,3
what is I?,0
I should be .00424 if im not mistaken,3
for me it would be 1.4/330,3
performed .76+1.4+2.37 with 4.53,6
for you guys it would be whatever your voltage is divided by resistor,3

changed r2 from 680 to 330 via change,6
i mean we can try that,2
i dont have a better idea hahaha,3
well we'll have to use V=IR,5
the resistances are added up R1 + R2 +R3,3

do we add r0?,0
"i think so, if you look below it has R0 in series with the other resistances",2
oh wait,9
yea nvm,3
is it different for everyone. mine is 330 ohms,3
on thing that we do know is that our current will remain the same,4
for all of us,0
i think we just need to obtain our needed voltage and then do the math for E,5
get that first then E,5

changed r1 from 1200 to 1000 via change,6
changed r1 from 1000 to 1000 via change,6
so the first person is the voltage after its been decreased by the r0,3

k one sec,9
look so when we find the total E we can pllug it into V=IR to find the resistance that we each need',5
so what i was thinking,3
we each indivdually have our own R0,3
so in the circuit below,3
we have R0 in series with R1 R2 R3,3
whats ya;;s r0?,0

we all have the same,3
i was adding 330 + my circuit + circuit 2 + circuit 3 for the total resistance,9
i think thats how this'll work,3
oh then yeah,2
we each have our own resistance,3
but is each of our voltages where they need to be? because mine is 0.05 off,10

Im at a resistance of 560 right now and im reading 3.29V. i need to get it to 5.82V,3
So we have to adjust to each other,5
changed r1 from 560 to 680 via change,6

so keep adjusting it?,0

shouldnt R1 do theirs first since its the first resistor?,0
changed r1 from 470 to 330 via change,6
changed r1 from 330 to 330 via change,6
performed 330*3 with 990,6
"Well, once R1 is done adjusting, R2 will adjust and mess it up",3
Im listening grape,1
Because the total current is dependent on the total resistance,3
We should settle on a total resistance,5
ok,0
So let's say the total resistance in is 2000 ohms,3
performed 19/2000 with 0.0095,6
Then the current would be 0.0095,3
"So the way we do it is make sure that as we adjust, all three of us add up to 1000 ohms",5
bet,0
With R1 having the higher resistance and R2 following then R3,3
The reason why all 3 of us need to add up to 1000 ohms is because R0 is 1000 ohms,3
So R1 goes first and sets it right?,0
Kinda,2
"R1, set your's to 500",9
Okay Grape i understand now,3

It has to be 470 ohms. We each have to have the same voltage drop and that means we multiply 4.75 by 3 and subtract the total (19) to get 4.75 V for the 470 ohm resistor meaning ours has to be 470 ohms,3

im lost,3
so we are trying to find total volts as well?,0
changed r1 from 470 to 390 via change,8
changed r1 from 390 to 390 via change,8
i think so not sure didnt write everything from that video,3

changed r2 from 47 to 47 via change,8
changed r2 from 47 to 82 via change,8
changed r2 from 82 to 82 via change,8
so its volts,3
thats what im guessing,0
only two units to choose from,3
im close to the number,10
same im .07 away,10
im at 4.34 and goal is 6.44,3
so increase ohms,5
220 ohm resistor,3
my goal is 1.71,3
mine is 7.77,3

now lets find e,5
is it sum of the ohms or the total of the goal volts,0
im at 680 ohms,3
180 ohms,3
im at 820,3
so 1680 ohms,3
and the total volts for everyone goal,0
or does that not matter,0
somehow it does matter idk,3
alright whats the total volts for your resistors,0
he said we need vin and total resistance,3

Yea,2
Dog = Circuit 1,3

this is a gorram mess,1
We all got 3.5v I think,3

changed r3 from 220 to 220 via change,8
or is it 3.5 total from our 3 combined,0
i think it's 3.5 each,3
which means there is a 3.5 loss across the 180 too,3
"ooook, so that's 12V total, the other two are getting lost from the 180?",0
10.5 reduction from us and 14 total,3
so i think if we all put 180 we'll get 3.5 each right?,0

oh i see that makes sense,3
performed 18.58/1000 with 0.01858,6
.01858 amps,3
ok so lets try that with ohms law then,5
we should match that amps,5
performed 2.27/.01858 with 122.1743811,6

my result would be ~122 ohms or 120 ohm is the closest,3

well wait,9
below,3
it says 24v is incorrect,3
24 isnt right,3
yeah I was about to say i think we made a logical error,2
24 volts was if we used that 4k ohm load,4
So we really need to find E first then,5
yeah,2
Should we use a 4k Resistance load?,0
im not sure what we get from doing t`hat in retrospect,3
thye current changes as the load changes,3
"so when we put the right load the current will change and thus our sum will be off again, right?",0
right,2
Yeah.,2

but it's still valid to take the measured current and back calculate,0
can we do this as a voltage divider where our three resisors are added to one and then it;s just the 1k and our aggregate?,0

so what can we do with our V drops and amps,0
performed 2.12*3 with 6.36,6
so we have 6.36 V of 8.76,3
that puts us kind of close,10
right now we total 6.36,3
right,2
so if we inch our way up by adding R,4
maybe we get to our desired V total with the wrong ohms,4
we can find the total resistance we have to reach,4
"right, then use the amps we find there",2
and we distributer around until we get our values,5

then we know the total resistance between our 3 resistors,4

"lets all go to 220, see what happens",5
so maynard and I have to increase  our r,9
changed r3 from 150 to 220 via change,6
changed r3 from 220 to 220 via change,6
changed r1 from 120 to 220 via change,6
changed r1 from 220 to 220 via change,6
3.38,3
just went to 220 and i am at 3.38,9
"one sec, my computer is slow as hell",9
ok right now our eq. reisstance is 880,3
changed r2 from 120 to 220 via change,6
bam,1
we got it,10
clicked submit,7
click we got it,10
clicked submit,7
circuit 1,3
circuit 3 needs 4.88 V,3
my resistance is 180,3
circuit 1 needs to be 7.06,3
so i think we all have different voltages,4
changed r1 from 390 to 470 via change,8
changed r1 from 470 to 390 via change,8
changed r1 from 390 to 330 via change,8
so we need to calculate the voltage drop over each and use to calculate our invidual resistor value,5
what do we need to get voltage drop again?,0
changed r1 from 330 to 270 via change,6
no the reading,2
changed r1 from 270 to 330 via change,6
so in my case I need 2.81 V,3
circuit 2?,0
i need 7.06 and  i am currently at 7.23,3
circuit 3 has resistance 330 atm,1
who is circuit 1,0
sorry i am circuit 1 nevermind,3
changed r3 from 100 to 220 via change,6
changed r3 from 220 to 220 via change,6
so we have to go in order since what ever circuit 1 is will effect the later,5
circuit 1 needs voltage to be 7.06,3
changed r3 from 220 to 330 via change,6
changed r3 from 330 to 330 via change,6
changed r3 from 330 to 270 via change,6

can no one change their resistor yet,0
performed 20.5*120 with 2460,6
"circuit 1, what current do you need?",0
i mean voltage,0
7.06,3
performed .12*20.5 with 2.46,6
circuit 2?,0
ok so the voltage drop from resistor 0 is,3
2.46,3
and I need 2.81,3
performed 16-2.46 with 13.54,6
"so, 12 - I(120) - 7.06 - 2.81 = 0",3
so starting with resistor 1. we have a voltage of 13.54 to work with,3
"whoops, forgot mine, -4.88",3
ciccuit one you need 7 Volts right,0
7.06,3
ok so using 14.54 as our starting voltagre,3
you need almost half of that,3
which means the sum or 2 and 3 equals youres,3
everyone follow?,0
***13.54,0
sort of,3
performed 12-7.06-2.81-4.88 with -2.75,6
resistor 1 what is your current resistor value,0
390,3
we can use that to get a current and then adjust your value to hit that voltage,5
performed 16-7.06-2.81-4.88 with 1.25,6
performed 1.2500000000000009/120 with 0.010416667,6
so 7.06/390,3
performed 7.06/.39 with 18.1025641,6
performed 7.06/390 with 0.018102564,6
i get a current of 18.1,3
0.018102564,3
yes,2
I got I = 0.0104,3
for the whole circuit,0
maynard your resistance is 7.06/your current,3
performed 4.88/0.010416666666666675 with 468.48,6

so that would be 392,3
my resistor is currently 390,3
"we all have the same current, should be 0.0104",3
ok let me try again,9
performed 7.06/.0104 with 678.8461538,6
so keep in mind we are in omhs,0
not kohms,0
now i got 678.846,3
changed r1 from 390 to 680 via change,6
should i change my resistor to 680 then?,0
for reistances,0
yes,2
ok just did that. my voltmeter now reads 7.50,9
now we go to circuit 2,5
so after your voltagre drop,3
performed 13.56-7.06 with 6.5,6
so there is 6.5 volts left,3
and I need 2.81 of that,3
performed 7.06/0.0104 with 678.8461538,6
performed 2.81/.0104 with 270.1923077,9
using the current of .01,3
performed 2.81/0.0104 with 270.1923077,6
i get a reistor or 270,3
changed r2 from 180 to 270 via change,6

what is everyone's voltage,0
3.5,3
circuit 1 voltage 7.44,3
mine currently reads 10.47,3
so we are trying to find the value of E?,0
or do you guys need to find R,0
nevermind,3
E - I(270) -7.44 - 3.5 - 5.06 = 0,3
yeah,2

e = 18,3
clicked submit,7
we all have 4.5v right?,0
yes but my voltage needs to be 5.06,2
"i know, but now we know e, we can calculate I",2
im getting a reading,3
ahh i see,0
what were voltages again?,0
circuit 1 7.44,3

changed r2 from 82 to 390 via change,6
changed r2 from 390 to 390 via change,6
you can guess and check from there but r1 needs to go first,5
then r2,5
i think?,0
yeah but we can calculate it if we all set r to 0 and find the current,2
but we can't change r0,2

how do we finish :'(,0
reverse it and hit submit,9
we don't,3

hi everyone,1
my goal is 4.5,3
same goal,0
ok,0
so how does this work?,0
changed r2 from 270 to 1000 via change,8
i think we are supposed to figure out how to get 4.5 volts overall cause all of our circuts are connected,4
and we're currently at 18 volts?,0
i would agree. I think the only thing we can change is the resistor,2
yeah,2
yes,2
yeah,2
changed r2 from 1000 to 27 via change,8
mine's at 14.91 now,3
okay mine is 2.03,3
how?,0
changed r2 from 27 to 1000 via change,6
opened zoom,7
now mine is 8.26,3
viewed 2 in zoom,7
so the current is the same throughout right?,0
viewed 3 in zoom,7
clicked submit,7
idk,3
dont press we got it yet,9
how does current relate to voltage?,0

changed r1 from 820 to 680 via change,6
changed r1 from 680 to 680 via change,6
okay i have 3.99,3
now just adjust the resistor until you get 4,5
or around 4 maybe,0
four what?,0
but circut 2 go before 3,3
opened zoom,7
4 on the little device in the corner,3
opened zoom,7
viewed 2 in zoom,7
viewed 3 in zoom,7
does that make sense,0
nan,1
on the multimeter,3
nan,1
changed r2 from 1000 to 1200 via change,6
changed r2 from 1200 to 1000 via change,6
so circut 2 adjust the resistor till you get 4 on the multimeter and then circut 3 adjust till you get 4 on the multimeter i think,5
???,0
idk what it's actually saying. Like under omega its 104,3
but under amp its 06.7,3
go to DCV 20,9
okay mine says -2.29,3
changed r2 from 1000 to 56 via change,6
now -3.30,3
changed r2 from 56 to 100 via change,6
okay so adjut it till you get -4,9
changed r2 from 100 to 150 via change,6
adjust how?,0
cause the - just means the probes are switched sides,3

my E is incorrect,10
do you put the dial somewhere else?,0
if its over 20 volts yes,2
should be on DCV 20,3
make sure that when you tested the voltage you had the wires unhooked from the breadboard,10

wait we should all have same current?,0
so get a current measurement,5
then solve,5
yeah?,0
that should work,4

for current I got 0.075,3
y'all reading same?,0
what??,0
ACV right?,0
oh wait nvm,3
wait ACV or AMP?,0
amp,3
it should be 9/120,4
which tab on amp?/,0
ahhh,0
"not sure, 200m?",0
good point,1
performed 9/120 with 0.075,6
should be .075 as you said,2
performed 9/120 with 0.075,6

thats odd,0
should all have same curretn in a series i thought,3
we should,3

lets try all making them the same,5
start at 220,5
we all need to use ohms law which is e=ir,5

performed 8-Feb with 0.25,6
Lets make circuits 1-3 and equivalent then voltage divide out to find each resistance,5
performed .25*50 with 12.5,6
performed 12.5/.75 with 16.66666667,6
i messed up on the equation the 8 and the 2 should be switched,3
150+r1+r2+r3=rtotal,3
when i do the math is says 16 ohms which doesnt make sense,3
Voltage = 8 V,3
i=8/150+r1+r2+r3,3
if we add the resistors will it give us a voltage drop of 2 across each resistor?,0
V=iReq,3
not sure,3
where v is going to be 2 V since yall said our goal is the same,3
so 2 = ((8/150)+Req)*Req,3
performed 8/150 with 0.053333333,6
2=(.05333*Req+Req),3
if Req 150+r1+r2+r3 and i is 8/150+r1+r2+r3 then its just going to give us 8 for v when you use v=iReq,4
2=(.05333*Req+Req)*Req,3
2=.05333*Req^2+Req^2,3
2=1.05333Req^2,3
performed 2/1.05333 with 1.898740186,6

req=1.3777,3
there isn't a resistance less than 10 ohms so sqrt of 1.8987 isn't going to work,2
Ah fuck,3
performed 25/4 with 6.25,6
seem to have hit a wall here,3
I keep using V0=V(R1/150+R1) but none of the numbers i get match the provided resistors,3
V0=2 and V=8 right?,0
V1R1 = V2R2 = V3R2,3
2R1 = 2R2 = 2R3,3
V0R0 = 2R1,3

Got it,3
I think its the voltage across the resistor we want to be 3.25?,0
we have to change the values of our resistors to get to the goal voltage,5

"we just enter one i think, like our voltages right now equal 13.06, so if we choose E to be 14, then r0's voltage would be .94",4
do we all choose the same E,0
E = IR and we can use our measured values of E and our resistance to determine I which is constant throughout and then use that and R0 to get E,5
i think,3
so where do we start,0
wait nevermind idk because the measured voltage changes based on what we all put,3
ok apparently you need a specific number,3
i tried entering 14 and it was wrong,9
well I=V/R,3

changed r1 from 270 to 56000 via change,6
changed r1 from 56000 to 330 via change,6

I think we have to have different resistance values,3
Maybe if all 3 of our resistances add up to 470 it will work,4
The tutorial showed all three having the same value. But I don't know.,3
we have to add the R0 to the toatl resistance,3
it is part of the circuit it is a 4th one,3

I'm not ready,2
What do we do,0
will we ever be ready tho?,1
What are we supposed to do?,0
Like whats the objective,0
okay so I'm R3 and my goal is 4 volts,3
My goal is also 4 volts,3
Idk which one I am tho,3
Is the voltage what appears on the meter?,0
Mine is also 4,3
we have to all work together to meet our voltage goals,4
How do you change your voltage?,0
I am circuit one. I think they want us to change the resistance until we get it right.,4
changed r1 from 120 to 10 via change,6
yeah so let's start by having every one measure their current voltage,2

Wait mine just went to zero,3
Now it just says zero,3
sorry i was messing around and unplugged the green wire,9
I think when you guys change yours it changes on our screens as well,4
I think messing with the green wires is how we change the voltages,4
all i can do with the green wire is take it out,3
and put it back in,3
opened zoom,7
what do the different colors mean on the resistor,0
okay nevermind haha,3
You can change the resistance on each of the colors,3
what idk what the TA just said,1
was it important?,1

I set it to 180,9
Mine says 2.36,3
and the meter said 2.36,3
Do we want 2.36?,0
So should we go up or lower,0
we want 4,5
"i think, right?",0
No I think the meter reads current,2
Oh dang,0
But resistance times current gives you vtage,3
votage,0
VOLTAGE,0
performed 680/16 with 42.5,6
"okay so E=IR, E=16, R0=680, so I=42.5",3
so the current is the same for all resistors,3
yEah^,2
"Yeap, that is what mine says",2
So are we looking for what times 680 gives us 4?,0
We want our current to be 170,4

Could you change it before?,1
Ehhhh could you change it before?,1
Like when we went to 150 could you change it,1
like when i click on the resistor no menu pops up to change it,1
i could change it in level A es,1
no,1

bc its the same current and same voltage drop across each one,3
V=IR and all that,3
so each one of our resistors will add up with the others to equal the R in V = IR,3
we need to find that R first by taking V/I,5
"yes, but to find the voltage drop at each resistor you have to use V=IR",2
performed 11/2.75 with 4,6
agreed,2
find I by using R0,5
its like 0.03 amps,3

you can find I buy using the multimeter,5

2V left or 2V as voltage drop for each resistor?,0
would be the same eiter way right,0
