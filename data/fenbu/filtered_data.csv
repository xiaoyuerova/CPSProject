5000,sent [chat] of [type],i think the 0.024 is the current not the voltage drop i think voltage drop for R0 is 0.08 because if you take 0.024 as current and 330 for the resistance and multiply them you get 7.92 and subtract the original voltage 8 a difference of 0.08 so wouldnt that be the volt drop???,SESU-P,SESU,1.0

5000,sent [chat] of [type],is it one of the formulas?,SESU-P,SESU,1.0
5000,sent [chat] of [type],im assuming we need to use formulas,CP-G,CP,8.0
5000,sent [chat] of [type],just need to figure out how,SSI-O,SSI,11.0
5000,sent [chat] of [type],I'm just confused on where we get the value of I,SSI-U,SSI,11.0
5000,sent [chat] of [type],isnt the current always the same throughout the circuit,SESU-P,SESU,1.0
5000,sent [chat] of [type],"yeah, but what is it. like which number would that be on the top",SN-A,SN,10.0
5000,sent [chat] of [type],try using the numbers that we found individually because if I is the same throughout the circuit we should all get the same answer,CP-S,CP,8.0
5000,sent [chat] of [type],maybe we do 1.56 = I x R0 and solve for I,SSI-O,SSI,11.0
4400,performed [calculation] with [result],1.56/1000,CE-E,CE,5.0
5000,sent [chat] of [type],thats really small number tho,SSI-O,SSI,11.0

5000,sent [chat] of [type],then I get.0019 and i dont think that is right,SSI-U,SSI,11.0
5000,sent [chat] of [type],do we just do V=IR to find I,SESU-P,SESU,1.0
5000,sent [chat] of [type],yea i get .00156 which doesnt seem right,SN-A,SN,10.0
5000,sent [chat] of [type],thats what we just tried,SSI-O,SSI,11.0
5000,sent [chat] of [type],you think 6.21 is right?,SESU-P,SESU,1.0
5000,sent [chat] of [type],i dont know,SSI-U,SSI,11.0
5000,sent [chat] of [type],oh i guess not because its not R0,SSI-O,SSI,11.0
5000,sent [chat] of [type],that im changing the value of,CEC-R,CEC,4.0
5000,sent [chat] of [type],ugh we just need I we have all the resistor values,CP-G,CP,8.0
5000,sent [chat] of [type],what are everyone's resistor values? caue maybe we add all the values up and multiply that by I to get it,SESU-P,SESU,1.0
5000,sent [chat] of [type],yea that is but we dont know I,SN-A,SN,10.0
5000,sent [chat] of [type],mines 180 ohms,SSI-O,SSI,11.0

4400,performed [calculation] with [result],1980/9.34,CE-E,CE,5.0
5000,sent [chat] of [type],wait wouldnt I be your goal voltage = I x the resistor you used to get the goal value,SESU-P,SESU,1.0
5000,sent [chat] of [type],then solve for I,CEC-S,CEC,4.0
4400,performed [calculation] with [result],5.88/680,CE-E,CE,5.0

4400,performed [calculation] with [result],1.9/220,CE-E,CE,5.0
5000,sent [chat] of [type],see if you get .0086470,CP-S,CP,8.0
5000,sent [chat] of [type],so for me 1.56V = I x 180ohms then I = 0.00867,SSI-O,SSI,11.0
