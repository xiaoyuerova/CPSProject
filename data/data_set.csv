81,82,"me and circle have been changing our resistances, but I dont think triangle has been",CEC-R,CEC-R,1
82,83,i have been,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
83,84,i added our volts and that wasnt it,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
84,85,i legit have no clue. i tried it in ohms and that didnt work,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
85,86,i did,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
86,87,i am at 150 and changed the meater,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
87,88,then go higher. Ill go lower,CEC-R,CEC-R,1

126,127,I did!,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
127,128,i did like a milliion years ago,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
128,129,"I did, it says 6.82",CEC-R,CEC-R,1
129,130,click on the wires,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
130,131,okay i did that,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
131,132,i tried that as well>,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
132,133,"ok, i think i need a 220 ohm resistor. putting it in.",CEC-R,CEC-R,1
133,134,i put in 270 but my voltmeter still shows 0,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
134,135,i put mine in,CEC-R,CEC-R,1

138,139,i dont have 240 ill set 220,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
139,140,I PLUGGED IT BACK IN,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
140,141,Done,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
141,142,done,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
142,143,done,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
143,144,I was trying values,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
144,145,Ill try doing some calculations,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
145,146,Im gonna drop a little bit,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
146,147,there now,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
147,148,done,CEC-R,CEC-R,1

149,150,I meant to change the resistance,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
150,151,okay done,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
151,152,done,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
152,153,done,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
153,154,Since the voltage drops are all the same since the Resistance is equal,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
154,155,i changed it to 330 and4.98,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
155,156,i did it try again,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
156,157,"820 is right i think, im there",CEC-R,CEC-R,1
157,158,I just bumped my resistance up to an extreme case,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
158,159,because i measured the amps again and it was different,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
159,160,I'll change it back,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
160,161,im changing it al ot,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
161,162,I thought I put it back to normal,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
162,163,I just set my resistor to 15,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
163,164,so ill drop mine alittle,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
164,165,Just changed it to 56,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
165,166,ill go up to 68,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
166,167,ill go up alittle,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
167,168,im changing my R now,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
168,169,i changed it to 100,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
169,170,im going to jump from 100 to 150 ohm now,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
170,171,i just can't,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
171,172,i clicked on it and then i cannot,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
172,173,let me calculate on scratch paper,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
173,174,I've switched my R to 220 ohms,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
174,175,I changed mine to 220 ohms as well,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
175,176,"I'm going to try to find the current based on that, then we should be able to calculate the remaining resistor values",CEC-R,CEC-R,1
176,177,"I had to mess with the leads a bit as well, they were not on when they appeared to be",CEC-R,CEC-R,1
177,178,I didn't change it.,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
178,179,I did to measure amperage.,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
179,180,ill do the math and yall can check me,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
180,181,Possibly but I'm not sure. I'll change mine now.,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
181,182,i changed mine,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
182,183,"i'm already did the calculation, the current 0.0222A",CEC-R,CEC-R,1
183,184,I did that,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
184,185,I put mine at 560,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
185,186,"so i just went from 560 to 470, and my voltage went down",CEC-R,CEC-R,1
186,187,I changed mine back to 220 and I'm at 2.15 and I need 2.18,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
187,188,I'll try going up,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
188,189,I cannged to 680 and I'm now at 5.35,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
189,190,let me tweek mine up and down and tell me what happens,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
190,191,I changed mine to 330,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
191,192,"Okay, mine is good",CEC-R,CEC-R,1
192,193,I'll lower mine,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
193,194,"I lowered mine some more, hopefully giving you guys some head room. What are your values now?",CEC-R,CEC-R,1
194,195,"I've just been lowering mine, I've hit 10 ohm",CEC-R,CEC-R,1
195,196,I raised mine up to 82 ohm,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
196,197,I dropped my resistance,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
197,198,im testing something,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
198,199,i raised my resistance,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
199,200,i have it entered,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
200,201,I am trying to spot match it,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
201,202,I'll drop mine and we'll what happens.,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
202,203,"Guitar, okay now I'll add mine in. 220 Ohms from me.",CEC-R,CEC-R,1
203,204,horn now just keep changing your resistance until you get to 4.25 V. It might work,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
204,205,I'll change mine to one setting lower.,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
205,206,Who's changing their resistor? I'm not touching mine.,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
206,207,i will,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
207,208,I changed mine to 3.9m Ohms and have 4.14 on mine.,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
208,209,i keep hovering between 1 and 4,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
209,210,Try changing it. I won't touch mine.,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
210,211,"Okay, I can't change it without it going out of bounds.",CEC-R,CEC-R,1
211,212,nevermind I got it,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
212,213,Not going to lie I'm just kind of playing guess and check with these resistor values,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
213,214,i changed mine to that,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
214,215,trying to figure out how to get e again,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
215,216,10.95 mA for current actually. needed to break the circuit,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
216,217,what i am going to do is break the circuit on my end and measure the current,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
217,218,i just put my circuit back together,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
218,219,alright ill keep mine together,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
219,220,ill keep mine together,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
220,221,okay no one touch anything and I will measure current,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
221,222,im going to leave mine at 560 ohms and 5.4 for now,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
222,223,okay so that gave me 398 but the closest resistance to choose from in 390 so i chose that and my meter is now reading 4.42,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
223,224,"ok aweseome, so now since lion got theres, i can get mine",CEC-R,CEC-R,1
224,225,hmm well i wont touch anything,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
225,226,so im going to use that as my current and change my resistance now and then i will tell you my voltage,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
226,227,already there,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
227,228,there,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
228,229,there,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
229,230,mines set,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
230,231,set,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
231,232,set,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
232,233,using 470??,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
233,234,let me try,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
234,235,using 330 ohms,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
235,236,3.86 at 390ohm gonna try back up to 470,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
236,237,i'll adjust next,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
237,238,ok ill change to 470,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
238,239,ok my next jump is to 560 which is 90 more who has the least jump in ohms,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
239,240,ill go up one resistor,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
240,241,i'll adjust,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
241,242,set,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
242,243,ok im going to adjust mine now 1 resistor at time,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
243,244,ill go up,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
244,245,I will,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
245,246,Okay I will try 390,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
246,247,okay so now i need to try to get my goal,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
247,248,1 sec I going to try to adjust mine I will try 270 then 390,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
248,249,I changed mine to 120 ohms and I'm close to 1.18 V: 1.12,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
249,250,okay let me try changing my resistance,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
250,251,ok I bump mine to 1k and really high now,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
251,252,Okay let me bump mine up,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
252,253,I need to raise mine,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
253,254,I was doing r/v=i which got me mixed up,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
254,255,That was me cuz i needed to to measure current. Our current is 10.18 millAmps,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
255,256,I tried: total R x I,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
256,257,okay stay there. next i'll increase mine,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
257,258,"just dropped to .77, let me try some others now",CEC-R,CEC-R,1
258,259,ok i changed to 560,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
259,260,i figured I based on my resistor and then calculated v on R0 using that.,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
260,261,i just plugged it back in,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
261,262,I calculated my resistance to be 390 ohms,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
262,263,I've connected mine,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
263,264,I'm doing the example he gave in class with 7R and 220 ohms etc,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
264,265,i changed the resistance to 180 Ohms on mine... dont know if yours is the same though,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
265,266,i changed mine to 560 ohms and now read 7.21 volts,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
266,267,I already did that several times. either way I go . Im too high or too low,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
267,268,I went low.,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
268,269,Ok. it changed mine too but not target goal,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
269,270,im going to 140. that was my too high,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
270,271,im doing the math from class today. almost done,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
271,272,okay so now i will try to change mine and see if yours changes to closer or further,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
272,273,im changing now to 220,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
273,274,i was trying to figure out how to arrange the resistors in my drowing,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
274,275,"give me a sec, ill calculate",CEC-R,CEC-R,1
275,276,I calculated the current for R1 to be 17.6mA,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
276,277,i used a 180 ohm resistor,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
277,278,that is what I calculated it should be around,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
278,279,i did 12- all of the other voltage drops we need,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
279,280,then divide that by 680,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
280,281,i changed mine to 100,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
281,282,It wont let me,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
282,283,I might've miss typed into the calc,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
283,284,I just added all those numbers together,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
284,285,I just added them...,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
285,286,doing that...,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
286,287,i entered 17v,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
287,288,i set my resistance to 150,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
288,289,i did,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
289,290,lol so i just stay,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
290,291,i need to lower my resistance and plum needs to increase resistance,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
291,292,um I found the voltage for R0 and then divided it by 330,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
292,293,Thats how i found the voltage^^,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
293,294,done,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
294,295,done,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
295,296,I entered the value for E,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
296,297,i did,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
297,298,ok i did 17-(3.76+2.09+9.48),CEC-R,CEC-R,1
298,299,i put it on the two wires and I'm at 2.62,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
299,300,i just disconnected mine,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
300,301,and put the reader on the two wires,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
301,302,done,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
302,303,i chose 330,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
303,304,i'll do it real quick,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
304,305,done,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
305,306,done,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
306,307,I fixed it,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
307,308,my bad i was just checking the current with the meter,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
308,309,alright i set mine to 470,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
309,310,"i set the resistance of mine to an arbirarily high value, so the other resistances will be insignificant",CEC-R,CEC-R,1
310,311,did that,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
311,312,i changed one band color to orange which was a lower number,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
312,313,ill go firsy,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
313,314,ok so me and dog move ohms down a bit,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
314,315,"it reset foe me, ill fix it",CEC-R,CEC-R,1
315,316,i can try changing mine,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
316,317,i left our RO,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
317,318,i just moved mine up and now im at 4.29,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
318,319,I haven't changed mine but now I'm at 1.38,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
319,320,here ill try,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
320,321,i can try going down one,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
321,322,i'll try,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
322,323,I went down to 120  ohms did that do anything,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
323,324,I went down to 1.49,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
324,325,ill do it,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
325,326,i went down one and now im at 3.95,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
326,327,same i clicked through the resistors to find one close to my goal but theres not one exact,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
327,328,that im changing the value of,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
328,329,let me change resistance,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
329,330,this is the closest i can get,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
330,331,let me do it again,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
331,332,i have  gone to a diifferent number to see if you lot can increase mine,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
332,333,im about to change,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
333,334,i changed my resistor to 270ohm,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
334,335,i increase mine to 470 and got a whole lot closer,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
335,336,increased my resistor,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
336,337,went back,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
337,338,gimmie a sec,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
338,339,dont ask me how was just messin around,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
339,340,i typed 17.47,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
340,341,i typed 17 V,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
341,342,idk what is right value but i am just trying to calculate it so that we have rough value,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
342,343,ight i went up one,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
343,344,I dont want to keep chanigng it if it's going to change others,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
344,345,I've been trying different numbers,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
345,346,Yeah i went up one when you went down,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
346,347,Ok I'm gonna give this a shot,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
347,348,i was adding 330 + my circuit + circuit 2 + circuit 3 for the total resistance,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
348,349,let me decrease mine,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
349,350,done,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
350,351,done,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
351,352,And I'll set it to 270,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
352,353,done,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
353,354,done my meter says 3.09,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
354,355,I disconnected my resistor from the board,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
355,356,no longer moving stuff,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
356,357,done,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
357,358,don,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
358,359,I need to go higher,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
359,360,Let me see.,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
360,361,done,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
361,362,Increased to 180 ohms and im sitting at 3.61V,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
362,363,I havent changed a thing,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
363,364,ah was left clicking,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
364,365,I literally did nothing for a solid 5 minutes,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
365,366,let me see if i can do addition,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
366,367,ill drop mine one down,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
367,368,im dropping,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
368,369,i went down so maybe go down with yours,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
369,370,try going up and well go down,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
370,371,i refreshed by accident,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
371,372,OK IM GONNA DECREASE MINE,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
372,373,im at 2.77 goin to 1.77,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
373,374,LET ME CHANGE MINE A LITTLE,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
374,375,cant go any higher,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
375,376,GONNA CHANGE MINE,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
376,377,i am,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
377,378,i am,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
378,379,im set,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
379,380,im going first,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
380,381,changed mine to 1k,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
381,382,just did,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
382,383,im good,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
383,384,there,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
384,385,just typing it,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
385,386,your lost i cant do shit,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
386,387,ive been trying the whole time and i cant get it to change,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
387,388,trying to calculate this shit,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
388,389,mines changed,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
389,390,i lowered mine to 120 cuz i was getting too hot,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
390,391,ok im going now,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
391,392,let me get some readings and ill do some math,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
392,393,ok ill try,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
393,394,i changed to 630r and im at 4.39 now,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
394,395,im gonna try the math,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
395,396,can you get any closer right now i just lowered my resistance,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
396,397,i opened the circuit,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
397,398,to measure current,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
398,399,closed again,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
399,400,ok ill adjust mine,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
400,401,ok plum adjust yours again,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
401,402,ok ill go again,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
402,403,let me try adjusting,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
403,404,ill try one more time,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
404,405,it brought mine to 4 something so i adjusted down one,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
405,406,im good,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
406,407,"so u guys can talk, ill just keep sending my value",CEC-R,CEC-R,1
407,408,ok ill try,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
408,409,ok ill try now,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
409,410,Got it i think. I just changed the resistor,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
410,411,i will change the resistor,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
411,412,ill take 680,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
412,413,thats what i have selected,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
413,414,Ima stay at 120,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
414,415,I moved upi to 150 and now im at 1.01 voly,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
415,416,I just switched the meter to amps,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
416,417,im going to 470,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
417,418,Because I took out my resistor and it read 15 volts,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
418,419,I'm leaving at 1k,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
419,420,Dropping mine from 560,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
420,421,I'll bump mine down one,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
421,422,i bump it up to 330 now,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
422,423,Bumping mine up one,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
423,424,i bump one down now,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
424,425,Bumping up,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
425,426,dropping to 8xxohm,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
426,427,Bumping down to 680,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
427,428,bumping back up,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
428,429,let me calculate,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
429,430,I did 3.78v/.0054870 and got 688.801Ohm,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
430,431,I did 3.97v (what the multimeter shows rn) divided by 390ohm (what the thing on the breadboard is rn),CEC-R,CEC-R,1
431,432,then divided my target voltage by .009718,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
432,433,moving mine from 390 to 330 puts me at 3.4,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
433,434,recalculated my current and it says my R should be 381ohm now,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
434,435,I'll go down one,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
435,436,I gotta go up,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
436,437,I didn't change,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
437,438,Gonna do 390,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
438,439,just did,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
439,440,im at 3.1 after i went up to 330ohms,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
440,441,dropping to 270 puts me back at 3.32,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
441,442,sorry i am calculating,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
442,443,let me calculate,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
443,444,I'm going back to 150,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
444,445,I'll just multiply it by 4,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
445,446,i rounded a few decimal places for reference,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
446,447,ok i'm locked in,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
447,448,well i tried a bunch of the usual; values for e and none worked,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
448,449,Set,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
449,450,done,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
450,451,okay im going to put my resistor up a notch,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
451,452,so let me put it at 270,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
452,453,done,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
453,454,i just went down from 220 to 180 and  our  voltage went down to 3.09,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
454,455,ill drop,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
455,456,i just dropped  to 150 and the voltmeter went to 2.95,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
456,457,so maynard and I have to increase  our r,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
457,458,just went to 220 and i am at 3.38,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
458,459,ok let me try again,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
459,460,ok just did that. my voltmeter now reads 7.50,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
460,462,set at 270,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
461,463,i entered it,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
462,464,i just set mine to max resistance and got 2.99,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
463,465,I just changed to 390 ohm,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
464,466,Am,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
465,467,changed mine,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
466,468,okay. let me change mine,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
467,469,done,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
468,470,i went down 1 and i'm at 3.5,CEC-R,CEC-R,1

499,501,let me try one more think,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
500,502,sorry i was trying to make a formula,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
501,503,alright im going to go down one notch,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
502,504,"it is, now its 3.09, gonna up it a bit",CEC-R,CEC-R,1
503,505,so blue's needs to go up. Green and i need to go down,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
504,506,ok i moved to 470 ohms,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
505,507,going down one more,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
506,508,bouta go down one more,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
507,509,So mine increased to 3.27,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
508,510,im going to try to increase my by one to see what happens,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
509,511,"ok, so you guys need to go up, i need to go down",CEC-R,CEC-R,1
510,512,let me move mine,CEC-R,CEC-R,1

538,540,I cant get close to 4.01,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
539,541,I can't change my resistor,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
540,542,I cant get close,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
541,543,keep yours the same. im going to go up one and down one,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
542,544,okay im going to move mine down towards 5.71. hang on,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
543,545,i am connected... just seeing what we go up to,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
544,546,im trying somemath here,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
545,547,mine wont move from zero,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
546,548,I'll see if moving mine will help. I'm at 470,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
547,549,I put mine on 390,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
548,550,I went to 390,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
549,551,i will go 470,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
550,552,changing one level up,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
551,553,i will try moving mine,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
552,554,ill go 390,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
553,555,I just went o 470,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
554,556,went back to 470,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
555,557,I moved mine up to 560,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
556,558,done,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
557,559,done,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
558,560,okat imma move mine up and see what happens cause im at 1.5,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
559,561,"i havent ,essed with mine im at 4.1 A and 1.8k",CEC-R,CEC-R,1
560,562,im leaving my resistance at 82. someone else leave theirs,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
561,563,i will leave mine at the same resistance,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
562,564,increase your resistance and us other two will adjust,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
563,565,I keep putting in,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
564,566,just changed mine to 680,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
565,567,just did,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
566,568,just did at 680 with 4.29,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
567,569,one sec ill adjust mine,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
568,570,i did 560 and got a voltage of 3,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
569,571,I set mine ot 330,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
570,572,Now 1.31 V but I did not change anything,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
571,573,I made mine 330 also,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
572,574,I'm summing up voltages now,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
573,575,I haven't changed anything yet so its' definitely me,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
574,576,I'm back where I started but I'm not changing anything till I get something on paper,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
575,577,i did and i still get nothing,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
576,578,I disconnected my resistor,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
577,579,didn't take leads out,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
578,580,i did,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
579,581,mine said 11.3 mA but now it says 0 and i didnt change anything,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
580,582,ive been doing that,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
581,583,But I just switched it to read voltage and its still at 0,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
582,584,i put my resistor at 100 just now,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
583,585,okay I'm changing my resistor from 680 to 270 so i can get closer to my goal,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
584,586,mine is higher now too. sleet keep yours the same. i'm gonna reduce my R by a little bit,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
585,587,i did that,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
586,588,let me try 680,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
587,589,i did and it says 3.24,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
588,590,I have no clue whats going on im just putting different resistances and hoping i get 7.16,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
589,591,"i did that too, not sure what to do with the number though",CEC-R,CEC-R,1
590,592,i need to go down,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
591,593,"at one point i had 1.05 with 27, so im going to leave mine",CEC-R,CEC-R,1
592,594,i hooked mine up and it says 4.34,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
593,595,i tried entering 14 and it was wrong,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
594,596,and i went down to 4.5,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
595,597,i did and im currently at .81,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
596,598,i just entered in my E starting from 1,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
597,599,I will,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
598,600,Has anyone found a value for I? Using E=IR I got I is 0.0255.,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
599,601,I selected the resistance given to me on the dropdown list but I'm getting 3.13V,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
600,602,I set my resistance to 39 ohms.,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
601,603,I was trying to think about the math...,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
602,604,me and hawk will chill until you get 2.5 V,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
603,605,okay. I'm gonna go up 1 level from where I am now,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
604,606,i went up to 120 ohms and 1.26 V,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
605,607,okay I went up a lot all the way to 270 ohms,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
606,608,i went down to 2.05 so I'm gonna go up 1 or two clicks,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
607,609,okay I did,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
608,610,i'm gonna go up one,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
609,611,i went up one and im now at 2.5,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
610,612,"I changed mine so im at 7.5 right now, change yours",CEC-R,CEC-R,1
611,613,I'll lower mine one,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
612,614,k i did and its at 3.35,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
613,615,"I had to up mine, it went down to 5 something once hawk changed",CEC-R,CEC-R,1
614,616,so let me go up 1,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
615,617,i went down to 330 ohms and am at 2.43,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
616,618,I went down one and now I'm at 6.34,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
617,619,i went up one and am at 2.92,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
618,620,exactly lemme calculate for you guys,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
619,621,i'm gonna drop mine a bit ad what happens,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
620,622,i dropped mine to 100 and my voltage stayed the same,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
621,623,i put it at the max resistance and nothing happened,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
622,624,i went back to 7 v,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
623,625,i just changed to maximum and no changes,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
624,626,i went back down to 6.99 V,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
625,627,I just set mine to 270 and its says 3.83,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
626,628,ill read the setting then yall respond with your reading,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
627,629,alright ill call em out,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
628,630,sorry i was messing around and unplugged the green wire,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
629,631,I set it to 180,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
630,632,"okay, let me try some things",CEC-R,CEC-R,1
631,633,OK WAIT I WANNA SEE SOMETHING,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
632,634,I need to go down,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
633,635,Im crunching numbers rn,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
634,636,Im not sure. That is what im trying to do,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
635,637,i got 4.5. I set the machine to 200 and changed the resistence to 220,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
636,638,"ill put mine to 18, both of you put yours at 22",CEC-R,CEC-R,1
637,639,ill choose 10,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
638,640,i just put mine to 180,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
639,641,i calculated the current,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
640,642,im trying to figure out a total R but im havin trouble,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
641,643,i cant get it there. theres a gap,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
642,644,i dropped mine to 100 ohms,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
643,645,when i put my multi meter across the two green wires (assuming that's the battery im getting 25),CEC-R,CEC-R,1
644,646,ive set my resistor to 12 ohms,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
645,647,I'm going to keep my resistor at 180 ohms,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
646,648,"Ok, I'll stop",CEC-R,CEC-R,1
647,649,going to 270 changes to 2.97,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
648,650,im at 1.89 volts rn so im going to raise mine now,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
649,651,if i change it o 220 it goes to 2.22,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
650,652,- just changed to 2.72,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
651,653,Red... could you try increasing yours and we will stay the same,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
652,654,now mine is at 2.88 but i havent changed anything,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
653,655,itll get us close and we can adjust from there,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
654,656,going to jump up one,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
655,657,im going to go back to 220 ohms,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
656,658,"still need to go up alot, so im going to go up to 270",CEC-R,CEC-R,1
657,659,going to up again since im the furthest,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
658,660,Maybe blue could make big changes and we can adjust accordingly,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
659,661,Setting my resistance to 820,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
660,662,My resistor is at 820 ohms and my voltage meter reads 5.77 I can't get it down .10,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
661,663,same i entered mine,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
662,664,"okay, i've set my resistor to 180 ohms and now my voltage is 1.43",CEC-R,CEC-R,1
663,665,I'm still trying to solve this,CEC-R,CEC-R,1
664,666,"changed, 220 now",CEC-R,CEC-R,1

2482,31677,got it,CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2483,31678,we got it,CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2484,31679,cause we all gave our goals met,CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2485,31680,its not the sum of resistances,CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2486,31681,i tried that and it didn't work,CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2487,31682,I just got it by setting my resistance to 330 and the dial to 200 DCV,CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2488,31683,I had it,CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2489,31684,Mine is at 2.9. We are close.,CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2490,31685,that seems too low for the data we have been getting,CMC-S,CMC-S,7

2521,31716,done,CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2522,31717,I'm closer to 2.75 at 390 though,CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2523,31718,damn its not right,CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2524,31719,"okay, did anyone change anything to make their voltages incorrect?",CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2525,31720,I think we all are good. I saw that Utah had the unknown value,CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2526,31721,im at 820 ohms and its close,CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2527,31722,I got it thanks,CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2528,31723,"I got it, nice job guys",CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2529,31724,i got it at 1k,CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2530,31725,Everyone good?,CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2531,31726,Close enough lol,CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2532,31727,im at goal,CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2533,31728,at goal,CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2534,31729,at goal,CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2535,31730,at goal,CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2536,31731,3.5 is my output now,CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2537,31732,i got it,CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2538,31733,ok mine is right now,CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2539,31734,Ok mine is too,CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2540,31735,ok mine is .02 off,CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2541,31736,ive got it,CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2542,31737,Ok i got mine,CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2543,31738,im as close as i can get,CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2544,31739,i got mine,CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2545,31740,got it,CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2546,31741,finally,CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2547,31742,so i'm on target,CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2548,31743,i've had the right voltage on my dmm for a minute now,CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2549,31744,im there exactly,CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2550,31745,im on target exactly,CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2551,31746,well was,CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2552,31747,got the voltage right,CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2553,31748,I got mine,CMC-S,CMC-S,7
2554,33704,gj,CM-G,CM-G,4
2555,34214,i got 3.96,CM-G,CM-G,4
2556,34320,What are you hitting red?,CM-G,CM-G,4
2557,39398,im good now,CM-S,CM-S,5
2558,40793,so we we need a total V for all 3 resistors to be 12.75v,CP-G,CP-G,8
2559,40794,we need to figure out R0 and E first,CP-G,CP-G,8
2560,40795,But its the total voltage that needs to be calculated,CP-G,CP-G,8
2561,40796,it still finds total V which we need,CP-G,CP-G,8
2562,40797,we have to figure out I first,CP-G,CP-G,8
2563,40798,We can get E first,CP-G,CP-G,8
2564,40799,What is your resistance set at? We have to figure out voltage total,CP-G,CP-G,8
2565,40800,we have to all change our own resistors to and try to get 4V,CP-G,CP-G,8
2566,40801,we need to get current,CP-G,CP-G,8
2567,40802,we need our multimeters voltage,CP-G,CP-G,8
2568,40803,to = that,CP-G,CP-G,8
2569,40804,we are going to try to get 7.17 v,CP-G,CP-G,8
2570,40805,our goal is to the voltage drop to 2.75,CP-G,CP-G,8
2571,40806,we need to adjust the values of all the three resisters to do it,CP-G,CP-G,8
2572,40807,but we need to know the i,CP-G,CP-G,8
2573,40808,"then on the multimeter, we have to calibrate each of our resistors until we see a 2 on the multimeter on all our screens",CP-G,CP-G,8
2574,40809,oh so we have to make sure its 2,CP-G,CP-G,8
2575,40810,We need to find E,CP-G,CP-G,8
2576,40811,We need to find R0's V and add it to 5.93 I think,CP-G,CP-G,8
2577,40812,Now we just need to get our Voltages back,CP-G,CP-G,8
2578,40813,we need 2 volts,CP-G,CP-G,8
2579,40814,We r supposed to reach 3 volts but there is 12 volts going through all three circuits.,CP-G,CP-G,8
2580,40815,Aye so we all need 1578.94 volts,CP-G,CP-G,8
2581,40816,then we can find our resistance,CP-G,CP-G,8
2582,40817,we have to alter our individual resistors,CP-G,CP-G,8
2583,40818,get whataever volts it says at top,CP-G,CP-G,8
2584,40819,i think we need to find the resistance for all our resistors,CP-G,CP-G,8
2585,40820,So we just need R0,CP-G,CP-G,8
2586,40821,we need voltage for R0 to get Et,CP-G,CP-G,8
2587,40822,so now we need to add them for the total,CP-G,CP-G,8
2588,40823,we need to do the same thing as before,CP-G,CP-G,8
2589,40824,one of you needs the highest ohms,CP-G,CP-G,8
2590,40825,so the red device is the voltameter and we set it to DCV 20,CP-G,CP-G,8
2591,40826,So should we just have one person create a circuit on paper that the rest of us must follow?,CP-G,CP-G,8
2592,40827,I think we should submit an E value first,CP-G,CP-G,8
2593,40828,Then we can find V0,CP-G,CP-G,8
2594,40829,We need to stop guessing and  calculate the values,CP-G,CP-G,8
2595,40830,Mine and Norths resistance ratio need to be .56,CP-G,CP-G,8
2596,40831,Mine and West resistance ratio need to be .2635,CP-G,CP-G,8
2597,40832,we need to have combined 580,CP-G,CP-G,8
2598,40833,wait we need E now,CP-G,CP-G,8
2599,40834,we gotta calculate current right now,CP-G,CP-G,8
2600,40835,i think we might be able to just measure the current,CP-G,CP-G,8
2601,40836,i think we need to calculate the current since that is a constant,CP-G,CP-G,8
2602,40837,so i was saying we know v= 15. we know amps is 2.2. we need to solve the equation:,CP-G,CP-G,8
2603,40838,We need our VOLTAGE to be 3.75,CP-G,CP-G,8
2604,40839,so then the resitsnace we need for R1 is .022*R=3.5,CP-G,CP-G,8
2605,40840,"3.8 here too, we all need the same resistance",CP-G,CP-G,8
2606,40841,"well, its looks like we all need to go down in V's",CP-G,CP-G,8
2607,40842,Ok. We need to have the voltage drops accross all 4 resistors ad up to 3.5 volts.,CP-G,CP-G,8
2608,40843,All of the resistors need to be 820 in order to 1/4 the voltage,CP-G,CP-G,8
2609,40844,"so we all have to get the right R (numerator value) so that when we add them up, our chosen value of each of them over the total equals .25",CP-G,CP-G,8
2610,40845,so now we all are going to need different (R/RT) ratios,CP-G,CP-G,8
2611,40846,"I think because the power is in series with all three of our boards, we have to get the resistance right in order of each of us",CP-G,CP-G,8
2612,40847,we need E,CP-G,CP-G,8
2613,40848,wrench needs to be very low im at 820,CP-G,CP-G,8
2614,40849,we need find the voltage supply first. give me a sec,CP-G,CP-G,8
2615,40850,we have to find E,CP-G,CP-G,8
2616,40851,okay now we need to find E,CP-G,CP-G,8
2617,40852,we need to find the percent of voltage each of us needs to consume,CP-G,CP-G,8
2618,40853,we have to find E now,CP-G,CP-G,8
2619,40854,I think we all have to change ours till each one of our voltmeters says 2.5 on it..,CP-G,CP-G,8
2620,40855,now we just need to solve for R on each of our resistors,CP-G,CP-G,8
2621,40856,we need to calculate the initial current with Ro,CP-G,CP-G,8
2622,40857,circuit 1 needs to get the correct voltage first.,CP-G,CP-G,8
2623,40858,So let's figure out the R0,CP-G,CP-G,8
2624,40859,ok we need to find e first,CP-G,CP-G,8
2625,40860,we have to find a way to express r0 in terms of the values we do have,CP-G,CP-G,8
2626,40861,i think we need to make our resistance add up to 420,CP-G,CP-G,8
2627,40862,I think in total we need to equal 578,CP-G,CP-G,8
2628,40863,oh shoot we need to find e,CP-G,CP-G,8
2629,40864,Thats cause we all need the have the right ones I think to get the exact,CP-G,CP-G,8
2630,40865,we need to find the voltage for R0,CP-G,CP-G,8
2631,40866,im assuming we need to use formulas,CP-G,CP-G,8
2632,40867,ugh we just need I we have all the resistor values,CP-G,CP-G,8
2633,40868,you need to  plug in e at the botttom  so when you  get close,CP-G,CP-G,8
2634,40869,we should have same number. because sum of all voltage is overal voltage,CP-G,CP-G,8
2635,40870,we need to match our goal with our multimeter tho,CP-G,CP-G,8
2636,40871,yeah but one of you need to chnage,CP-G,CP-G,8
2637,40872,that was my question as well... I was trying to use I=E/R0+R1+R2+R3 but we still need I's values,CP-G,CP-G,8
2638,40873,okay well we need to agree on what our resistances will be,CP-G,CP-G,8
2639,40874,so we need to enter our own voltage,CP-G,CP-G,8
2640,40875,we need to find E,CP-G,CP-G,8
2641,40876,we need to find the current,CP-G,CP-G,8
2642,40877,we need to find E and I,CP-G,CP-G,8
2643,40878,"Ok. So now we have to balance it out.  So R1 is gonna have the biggest resistance, then R2, then R3.",CP-G,CP-G,8
2644,40879,Kinda... We have to all balance each other out.,CP-G,CP-G,8
2645,40880,But we need to make sure that we keep track of the total resistance,CP-G,CP-G,8
2646,40881,We need to figure out E,CP-G,CP-G,8
2647,40882,wwe have to fill in voltage at the bottom for this circuit,CP-G,CP-G,8
2648,40883,ok so i need to be at 1.55 volts,CP-G,CP-G,8
2649,40884,i think we have to connect one of the leads to the green part to find the voltage,CP-G,CP-G,8
2650,40885,so what was he saying we all need a different resistor,CP-G,CP-G,8
2651,40886,gotta find current first then its v over i,CP-G,CP-G,8
2652,40887,to find I are we just doeing 13v/1000,CP-G,CP-G,8
2653,40888,starting with 6v and we need to make 1.5v,CP-G,CP-G,8
2654,40889,And we have to calculate E it looks like,CP-G,CP-G,8
2655,40890,So we collectively gotta adjust our resistor to make the thing say 3.75v,CP-G,CP-G,8
2656,40891,We're trying to find our target total v,CP-G,CP-G,8
2657,40892,So now we have to find the Voltage first,CP-G,CP-G,8
2658,40893,And put it in the unknown,CP-G,CP-G,8
2659,40894,we should match that amps,CP-G,CP-G,8
2660,40895,So we really need to find E first then,CP-G,CP-G,8
2661,40896,I guess we need to find the current somehow.,CP-G,CP-G,8
2662,40897,we need 2.92 each while at equal Rs,CP-G,CP-G,8
2663,40898,but we need to report our changing V,CP-G,CP-G,8
2664,40899,we needed 8 something,CP-G,CP-G,8
2665,40900,we need to find an equivalent resistance  between the  3 of us that makes the voltage drop 3 v,CP-G,CP-G,8
2666,40901,so we have to measurte the current,CP-G,CP-G,8
2667,40902,we need a E,CP-G,CP-G,8
2668,40903,so we need equal resistance to divide it out evenly,CP-G,CP-G,8
2669,40904,i think we need to get close again,CP-G,CP-G,8
2670,40905,But we need to get the voltage to 2.75,CP-G,CP-G,8
2671,40906,We need all of our voltage to be the same,CP-G,CP-G,8
2672,40907,i think we need to strategist what makes it change,CP-G,CP-G,8
2673,40908,we need to calculate E,CP-G,CP-G,8
2674,40909,we need all values to calculate,CP-G,CP-G,8
2675,40910,i think we just need to find the different volts,CP-G,CP-G,8
2676,40911,thats what we need to find,CP-G,CP-G,8
2677,40912,"ok, now lets find our goals",CP-G,CP-G,8
2678,40913,hold on lets try and figure out what happens as we switch,CP-G,CP-G,8
2679,40914,we need to work on getting the higher one complete first before moving on to the smaller ones,CP-G,CP-G,8
2680,40915,we should have two people set theirs to 390 and one to 470,CP-G,CP-G,8
2681,40916,and vise versa,CP-G,CP-G,8
2682,40917,we need it to read 4.0,CP-G,CP-G,8
2683,40918,i feel like we need to be on 200 avc,CP-G,CP-G,8
2684,40919,someone changed something now im a7 3.5,CP-G,CP-G,8
2685,40920,we all need to use ohms law which is e=ir,CP-G,CP-G,8
2686,40921,our resistance needs to be equivalent to 737 ohms when added together.,CP-G,CP-G,8
2687,40922,we need to solve for E,CP-G,CP-G,8
2688,40923,nvm lol we want the red meter to just read 2.00 volts,CP-G,CP-G,8
2689,40924,we need the e and ro,CP-G,CP-G,8
2690,40925,The circuit across the bottom is what we have to make individually,CP-G,CP-G,8
2691,40926,We have to work together on the three resistors at the bottom,CP-G,CP-G,8
2692,40927,"ok that makes sense. with that, wee need to have the same value resistance",CP-G,CP-G,8
2693,40928,we have a total of 5.87V goal,CP-G,CP-G,8
2694,40929,I think we need a total of 606 ohms,CP-G,CP-G,8
2695,40930,we have to get to our goal voltage now,CP-G,CP-G,8
2696,40931,to find the current,CP-G,CP-G,8
2697,40932,we still have to find E,CP-G,CP-G,8
2698,40933,so we need to find the current,CP-G,CP-G,8
2699,40934,As far as I can we just need to get 3 volts.,CP-G,CP-G,8
2700,40935,i think we need to find that out,CP-G,CP-G,8
2701,40936,we want 4,CP-G,CP-G,8
2702,40937,we need to make all of ou resistances add up to 60,CP-G,CP-G,8
2703,40938,wait all of the individual voltage drops need to be 4.5,CP-G,CP-G,8
2704,40939,all of our meters have to add up to 1.75,CP-G,CP-G,8
2705,40940,so i talked to the TA and i think she was saying that all of our voltmeters need to equal 1.75 so seagull can you get yours to say 1.75,CP-G,CP-G,8
2706,40941,they should all be 2.75,CP-G,CP-G,8
2707,40942,So we all need to have resistors that sum up to have 2.75 volts across,CP-G,CP-G,8
2708,40943,"okay so every resistor needs to have 4.5 volts through it, including R0",CP-G,CP-G,8
2709,40944,just match your multimeter to your coal,CP-G,CP-G,8
2710,40945,we have to enter the resistor values again,CP-G,CP-G,8
2711,40946,We gotta figure out the supply,CP-G,CP-G,8
2712,40947,we need to figure out the resistor 0,CP-G,CP-G,8
2713,40948,whos the captain lol,CP-M,CP-M,9
2714,40949,okay stay there snow. Sleet go lower than 150. Ill go higher,CP-M,CP-M,9
2715,40950,Okay well circuit 1 needs to secure theirs,CP-M,CP-M,9
2716,40951,so that bear can then get theirs at 3.25,CP-M,CP-M,9
2717,40952,and then finally me,CP-M,CP-M,9
2718,40953,i would say me and green go up and blue go down,CP-M,CP-M,9
2719,40954,!st perso gets their value,CP-M,CP-M,9
2720,40955,then second,CP-M,CP-M,9
2721,40956,then me,CP-M,CP-M,9
2722,40957,well aybe we have one person up while the others stay at 100,CP-M,CP-M,9
2723,40958,so just keep messing with the different ohm sized,CP-M,CP-M,9
2724,40959,just make our resistor all 390,CP-S,CP-S,10
2725,40960,we could experiment with the higher resistances then,CP-S,CP-S,10
2726,40961,ok lets just set our resistor to 390,CP-S,CP-S,10
2727,40962,can you try the same,CP-S,CP-S,10
2728,40963,click on resistor and change the value if you want to,CP-S,CP-S,10
2729,40964,change value for r,CP-S,CP-S,10
2730,40965,we can try it,CP-S,CP-S,10
2731,40966,divide your voltage value by that current and shoudl give you your resistor value needed,CP-S,CP-S,10
2732,40967,we can use that to find E,CP-S,CP-S,10
2733,40968,easier way,CP-S,CP-S,10
2734,40969,everyone just set your R value to 180 ohms and read the voltage,CP-S,CP-S,10
2735,40970,divide your wanted voltage by .007,CP-S,CP-S,10
2736,40971,Set the resistor to 470 ohms and you will get 3.03V,CP-S,CP-S,10
2737,40972,You can use that to find the voltage over R0,CP-S,CP-S,10
2738,40973,You have to use the current to find V0 and add them,CP-S,CP-S,10
2739,40974,Take your specific voltage divided by your resistance,CP-S,CP-S,10
2740,40975,try going down again,CP-S,CP-S,10
2741,40976,I think we all need to go up higher again,CP-S,CP-S,10
2742,40977,maybe higher,CP-S,CP-S,10
2743,40978,maybe try one at a really small resistance,CP-S,CP-S,10
2744,40979,just have one person stay at a small resistance,CP-S,CP-S,10
2745,40980,go high up lettuce and tomato,CP-S,CP-S,10
2746,40981,so we gotta go highe,CP-S,CP-S,10
2747,40982,keeping going up,CP-S,CP-S,10
2748,40983,GO BACK,CP-S,CP-S,10
2749,40984,But try using that resistance to calculate current,CP-S,CP-S,10
2750,40985,"Use your resistance and your voltage to get the current. We know the formula, so we might be able to get E and work backwards",CP-S,CP-S,10
2751,40986,lets work back down and who ever gets their voltage first,CP-S,CP-S,10
2752,40987,find their current,CP-S,CP-S,10
2753,40988,"lets try 33ohms, 47, and 68",CP-S,CP-S,10
2754,40989,everyone set R to 100Ohms,CP-S,CP-S,10
2755,40990,"we can just measure the current, and use that to get E",CP-S,CP-S,10
2756,40991,everyone set to 1k again and check V,CP-S,CP-S,10
2757,40992,from here use goal voltages to find your R,CP-S,CP-S,10

2895,41130,Lets try one more,CP-S,CP-S,10
2896,41131,Keep messin with numbers,CP-S,CP-S,10
2897,41132,divide the R0,CP-S,CP-S,10
2898,41133,then use your goal voltage to get your R,CP-S,CP-S,10
2899,41134,change it to 120,CP-S,CP-S,10
2900,41135,same method,CP-S,CP-S,10
2901,41136,find V0 first,CP-S,CP-S,10
2902,41137,then divide by R0,CP-S,CP-S,10
2903,41138,use your voltage divide 0.0153,CP-S,CP-S,10
2904,41139,change your resistance to that value,CP-S,CP-S,10

2906,41141,would you change it to the value,CP-S,CP-S,10
2907,41142,would you enter the E at the bottom of the chat window?,CP-S,CP-S,10
2908,41143,put it at 150,CP-S,CP-S,10
2909,41144,which means that we have to all adjust our resisters accordingly,CP-S,CP-S,10
2910,41145,go to 180,CP-S,CP-S,10
2911,41146,go to 2.2 K,CP-S,CP-S,10
2912,41147,Everyone else go to 10 and we can work our way up,CP-S,CP-S,10
2913,41148,go to 220,CP-S,CP-S,10
2914,41149,go to 470,CP-S,CP-S,10
2915,41150,go to a lower number then,CP-S,CP-S,10
2916,41151,I think we need to solve for E using Ohm's Law,CP-S,CP-S,10
2917,41152,put your R to 820,CP-S,CP-S,10
2918,41153,double click on the R,CP-S,CP-S,10
2919,41154,change to 820,CP-S,CP-S,10
2920,41155,use your V divide 0.0057 for R,CP-S,CP-S,10
2921,41156,throw ur leads on resistor,CP-S,CP-S,10
2922,41157,put 150 ohm resistor,CP-S,CP-S,10
2923,41158,go 180,CP-S,CP-S,10
2924,41159,basically add all our voltages,CP-S,CP-S,10
2925,41160,subtract from ET,CP-S,CP-S,10
2926,41161,start multiplying by resistors till u get ur goal,CP-S,CP-S,10
2927,41162,so divide your goal voltage with 6.6 mA and that should be your resistance,CP-S,CP-S,10
2928,41163,both of you go 1 higher ill go 1 lower,CP-S,CP-S,10
2929,41164,one of yall has to go up,CP-S,CP-S,10
2930,41165,one of you two need to go up,CP-S,CP-S,10
2931,41166,you guys go up one at a time and lets see what it does,CP-S,CP-S,10
2932,41167,put 8 volts in the sqare,CP-S,CP-S,10
2933,41168,put 8 and Volts for the unknown value,CP-S,CP-S,10
2934,41169,"0.01 off, someone needs to adjust",CP-S,CP-S,10
2935,41170,iowa and i have to adjust,CP-S,CP-S,10
2936,41171,someone move theirs down by one,CP-S,CP-S,10
2937,41172,we might have to guess,CP-S,CP-S,10
2938,41173,we should all be at 470,CP-S,CP-S,10
2939,41174,divided by battery voltage,CP-S,CP-S,10
2940,41175,try it,CP-S,CP-S,10
2941,41176,let's find V,CP-S,CP-S,10
2942,41177,"everyone, make ya R 100",CP-S,CP-S,10
2943,41178,try it,CP-S,CP-S,10
2944,41179,so divide your goal voltage by that and put in that resistance,CP-S,CP-S,10
2945,41180,okay so same as before?,CP-S,CP-S,10
2946,41181,make all our resistors the same,CP-S,CP-S,10
2947,41182,find the right one that works with 120 ohms,CP-S,CP-S,10
2948,41183,try 120,CP-S,CP-S,10
2949,41184,we can then use current to find resistance,CP-S,CP-S,10
2950,41185,also make sure your resistor is actually plugge din,CP-S,CP-S,10
2951,41186,we should all start with 680 ohm resistors and then find the current through the measured voltage?,CP-S,CP-S,10
2952,41187,lets all put in 100 ohm resistors in for a minute.,CP-S,CP-S,10
2953,41188,i mean we can find the current right now,CP-S,CP-S,10
2954,41189,quickly start increasing your resistances,CP-S,CP-S,10
2955,41190,increase a bit more,CP-S,CP-S,10
2956,41191,should we try guessing voltages,CP-S,CP-S,10
2957,41192,i think we all need to go down abit,CP-S,CP-S,10
2958,41193,do 120 then 240,CP-S,CP-S,10
2959,41194,we can go from there,CP-S,CP-S,10
2960,41195,so lets find the current,CP-S,CP-S,10
2961,41196,and use V = IR to find our resistances,CP-S,CP-S,10
2962,41197,"So V = 5.8, I = .03333, and you solve for R = V / I",CP-S,CP-S,10
2963,41198,so we add all our voltages required and subtract it from 11V(total EMF). then we divided that Voltage with 330 ohms and that's the correct current of the circuit,CP-S,CP-S,10
2964,41199,set the R to 560 ohms,CP-S,CP-S,10
2965,41200,just try,CP-S,CP-S,10
2966,41201,let's see if it works,CP-S,CP-S,10
2967,41202,lets find E,CP-S,CP-S,10
2968,41203,Put in your current volts,CP-S,CP-S,10
2969,41205,same thing change resistor value to 820,CP-S,CP-S,10
2970,41206,"Divide the voltage value you need by that number,and thats your resistance valuea",CP-S,CP-S,10
2971,41207,Alright lets set E equal to 12volts just for reference,CP-S,CP-S,10
2972,41208,Divide your voltage by .0242 and set that to be your resistor,CP-S,CP-S,10
2973,41209,The thing is we might need to choose a different E to get our value,CP-S,CP-S,10
2974,41210,Lets try 16 volts for E,CP-S,CP-S,10
2975,41211,The thing is we can find v0 if we just take a known battery voltage as a reference to find current,CP-S,CP-S,10
2976,41212,every body bring it up 1 values,CP-S,CP-S,10
2977,41213,wait nobody touch anything what is everybodys resistor values,CP-S,CP-S,10
2978,41214,up to 470,CP-S,CP-S,10
2979,41215,guys enter 7 volts for the unknown in the box below,CP-S,CP-S,10
2980,41216,"ok, let's math this",CP-S,CP-S,10
2981,41217,everyone go to,CP-S,CP-S,10
2982,41218,"ok, let's go 1 option down",CP-S,CP-S,10
2983,41219,everyone try 1000,CP-S,CP-S,10
2984,41220,everyone divide your voltage by the current,CP-S,CP-S,10
2985,41221,"i think we have to use the same resistance, add it up, and find the current",CP-S,CP-S,10
2986,41222,lets do 100 Ohms,CP-S,CP-S,10
2987,41223,you have to submit the battery voltage first,CP-S,CP-S,10
2988,41224,everyone to 100 ohms again?,CP-S,CP-S,10
2989,41225,everyone calculate current through their thingy,CP-S,CP-S,10
2990,41226,we gotta make 2 equations,CP-S,CP-S,10
2991,41227,the first one we have is the following,CP-S,CP-S,10
2992,41228,everyone go to 220 Ohms,CP-S,CP-S,10
2993,41229,i got the resistance with the equation with the 0.0208 amps. but to find our own resistances we gotta get another one,CP-S,CP-S,10
2994,41230,lets figure out our current first,CP-S,CP-S,10
2995,41231,well we can't change v or r0,CP-S,CP-S,10
2996,41232,Originally i thought we could subtract all the voltages we know as our goals and then we would have some left over value,CP-S,CP-S,10
2997,41233,one of you need to enter that on the bottom right of the screen,CP-S,CP-S,10
2998,41234,some one needs to type in 19,CP-S,CP-S,10
2999,41235,all go to 470,CP-S,CP-S,10
3000,41236,ohhh try 870,CP-S,CP-S,10
3001,41237,don't change anything real quick,CP-S,CP-S,10
3002,41238,so for this i think we need to set up a system of equations where when we change the voltage we need to calculate the total voltage and set it equal to each other and then find current,CP-S,CP-S,10
3003,41239,okay so now one of us need to change their voltage,CP-S,CP-S,10
3004,41240,do it,CP-S,CP-S,10
3005,41241,and then put everyones new values in the chat,CP-S,CP-S,10
3006,41242,well we can try one then the other,CP-S,CP-S,10
3007,41243,so do 0.086 first,CP-S,CP-S,10
3008,41244,do it,CP-S,CP-S,10
3009,41245,use ohms law to see what r needs to be to get the correct v,CP-S,CP-S,10
3010,41246,i mean we can try that until we get something that makes sense,CP-S,CP-S,10
3011,41247,ok lets try to use ohms law,CP-S,CP-S,10
3012,41248,Set r1 is 170,CP-S,CP-S,10
3013,41249,Let's all go up to 82 and see what happens,CP-S,CP-S,10
3014,41250,"Unhook the two green wires, and then place your probes on them, then change your meter to measure mA, I believe",CP-S,CP-S,10
3015,41251,"Lets let Hawk gets theirs right first, and we can move down the circut",CP-S,CP-S,10
3016,41252,Lets all go down in R so we can change by smaller increments,CP-S,CP-S,10
3017,41253,we can try to work around,CP-S,CP-S,10
3018,41254,so you can try to use I = 0.005Amp,CP-S,CP-S,10
3019,41255,try E = 10.57V,CP-S,CP-S,10
3020,41256,ok move on!,CP-S,CP-S,10
3021,41257,then you guys have to change your R,CP-S,CP-S,10
3022,41258,everybody stop changing the resistance,CP-S,CP-S,10
3023,41259,I think one person should do the calculations and tell the rest what to do so we aren't switching it on eachother. What do you think?,CP-S,CP-S,10
3024,41260,if that is the case you can click on the reisistor to change the value,CP-S,CP-S,10
3025,41261,We first need to use what data we have to calculate the total circuit resistance. From there we can calculate what each of our resistor values should be to obtain our goal voltage.,CP-S,CP-S,10
3026,41262,"try to chose 1k resistor and measure it if the voltage not as your goal, change the resistor",CP-S,CP-S,10
3027,41263,someone drop their resistance one by one,CP-S,CP-S,10
3028,41264,and then change it back to 270,CP-S,CP-S,10
3029,41265,Lets try and get 6.8,CP-S,CP-S,10
3030,41266,everyone disconnect your resistors.  I have a plan,CP-S,CP-S,10
3031,41267,now attach to the multimeter and see if any value is given,CP-S,CP-S,10
3032,41268,when everyone has theirs changed type what your voltage value is,CP-S,CP-S,10
3033,41269,so lets try all going down one value on our resistors and see what happens,CP-S,CP-S,10
3034,41270,change your risistors to 470,CP-S,CP-S,10
3035,41271,"multiply the percentage of your voltage goal by the total voltage, then multiply that by 1100",CP-S,CP-S,10
3036,41272,someone increase theirs by 1,CP-S,CP-S,10
3037,41273,"same, we need to enter 13 for the unknown value",CP-S,CP-S,10
3038,41274,"Okay, everyone set theirs to 10 ohm and we'll start from Guitar, then Piano, then Horn.",CP-S,CP-S,10
3039,41275,someone go down on their resistor,CP-S,CP-S,10
3040,41276,we can try it,CP-S,CP-S,10
3041,41277,Lets all bump up to 150 and see what it does,CP-S,CP-S,10
3042,41278,change to 390 on all resistors,CP-S,CP-S,10
3043,41279,try 120,CP-S,CP-S,10
3044,41280,Let's just try 14v haha,CP-S,CP-S,10
3045,41281,"ok how about this, we all break the circuit between the wire and one end of the resistor and measure current at the same time",CP-S,CP-S,10
3046,41282,"so, once lion figures out the proper voltage then i can find mine with the voltage lion gives me.",CP-S,CP-S,10
3047,41283,"I was thinking that once we know total current, we can use I*R=V and solve for R",CP-S,CP-S,10
3048,41284,what if we did 11-all of our voltages so we knew R0s voltage and since we know its resistance find the current,CP-S,CP-S,10
3049,41285,"the other option would be to have lion go first and get the proper voltage, then me, then tiger.",CP-S,CP-S,10
3050,41286,A less volatile way imo is to add our resistances and R0,CP-S,CP-S,10
3051,41287,then we do V/R to find total circuit current,CP-S,CP-S,10
3052,41288,and just get as close as possible,CP-S,CP-S,10
3053,41289,thats why i was saying we should use the 11-3.85-.83-5.64 and then would have their voltage and then just take that voltage and divide it by their resistance which is 100,CP-S,CP-S,10
3054,41290,lets try that,CP-S,CP-S,10
3055,41291,lets rerun the numbers with that,CP-S,CP-S,10
3056,41292,lets run with it,CP-S,CP-S,10
3057,41293,lets try it,CP-S,CP-S,10
3058,41294,"lets all set our R to 680??, then 4*our V will be the source",CP-S,CP-S,10
3059,41295,so take it with the target V,CP-S,CP-S,10
3060,41296,change back,CP-S,CP-S,10
3061,41297,re run the #,CP-S,CP-S,10
3062,41298,set resistors to 10,CP-S,CP-S,10
3063,41299,keep your resistors at 10 ohms,CP-S,CP-S,10
3064,41300,well i guess thats not gonna work so we can all try to get to our need values,CP-S,CP-S,10
3065,41301,so we need to let each other know when we will make a change,CP-S,CP-S,10
3066,41302,I guess we could find that out,CP-S,CP-S,10
3067,41303,try that,CP-S,CP-S,10
3068,41304,round it to 17,CP-S,CP-S,10
3069,41305,everyone just enter 17,CP-S,CP-S,10
3070,41306,Someone needs to change their resistor. Is everyone at 680?,CP-S,CP-S,10
3071,41307,find total resistance based on the 1000 ohm resistor and figure the rest based on that...or just guess,CP-S,CP-S,10
3072,41308,everyone leave everything the same for a minute,CP-S,CP-S,10
3073,41309,someone else should try,CP-S,CP-S,10
3074,41310,i was thinking if we could add all of our individual voltages together we could get E but we'd still be missing R0's amps,CP-S,CP-S,10
3075,41311,im obviously thinking about this wrong. we can figure out v based on percentage now thouygh,CP-S,CP-S,10
3076,41312,"So, by using Ohm's law, the current for the circuit should be approximately 0.01524242424242424 A. So, we should be able to calculate the requred resistance for each of our resistors based on that number.",CP-S,CP-S,10
3077,41313,"Well, current on the multimeter and the calculate voltage",CP-S,CP-S,10
3078,41314,everyone needs to keep their wires connected except for 1 person,CP-S,CP-S,10
3079,41315,the odd one out removes the wires from the bread board and measures the voltage,CP-S,CP-S,10
3080,41316,"What I'm saying is we pull the green cords to take out the resistors, use our multimeters to provide a connection (set to find amps), and we find the current without our resistors and use the resistance on R0 to find voltage",CP-S,CP-S,10
3081,41317,so we all need to pull the green cords out,CP-S,CP-S,10
3082,41318,okay we can try it,CP-S,CP-S,10
3083,41319,and connect the multimeter,CP-S,CP-S,10
3084,41320,ok new plan,CP-S,CP-S,10
3085,41321,literally all you do ( i think) is connect the leads and set the meter to voltage,CP-S,CP-S,10
3086,41322,all you do is click the resistor to change it,CP-S,CP-S,10
3087,41323,false. hasn't budged. maybe we need to try something else,CP-S,CP-S,10
3088,41324,disconnect the jumper cables,CP-S,CP-S,10
3089,41325,and reconnect,CP-S,CP-S,10
3090,41326,refresh the browser. oh well,CP-S,CP-S,10
3091,41327,"Move it up or down, it is going to be too low or too high. but move adjust it and leave it there and see if it has an effect on ours and then we can adjust accordingly",CP-S,CP-S,10
3092,41328,just connect everything together and change youre resistance....,CP-S,CP-S,10
3093,41329,go to 390,CP-S,CP-S,10
3094,41330,OK skillet you measure the current through your side and us other two will not touch anything,CP-S,CP-S,10
3095,41331,try it now,CP-S,CP-S,10
3096,41332,go to 180 ohm,CP-S,CP-S,10
3097,41333,wait everyone go to 150,CP-S,CP-S,10
3098,41334,all you ha to do was calulate the voltage drop acros R0,CP-S,CP-S,10
3099,41335,ight so we can measure the in voltage,CP-S,CP-S,10
3100,41336,So R1 should be able to calculate its required resistance for required voltage.,CP-S,CP-S,10
3101,41337,Then R2 can find its current and then calculate its resistance to get the required voltage.,CP-S,CP-S,10
3102,41338,measure to make sure tho,CP-S,CP-S,10
3103,41339,just do the 20 m setting,CP-S,CP-S,10
3104,41340,lets try,CP-S,CP-S,10
3105,41341,Click \,CP-S,CP-S,10
3106,41342,click \,CP-S,CP-S,10
3107,41343,You have to break the circuit,CP-S,CP-S,10
3108,41344,Make sure only one of you has a wire pulled at a time,CP-S,CP-S,10
3109,41345,"Tiger, can you connect your wires? then we can measure our voltages",CP-S,CP-S,10
3110,41346,"Okay, try 100 ohms then",CP-S,CP-S,10
3111,41347,and put your wires in so we can check,CP-S,CP-S,10
3112,41348,Make sure you enter the 17 volts,CP-S,CP-S,10
3113,41349,click pn the colored markings,CP-S,CP-S,10
3114,41350,click on it,CP-S,CP-S,10
3115,41351,everyone set theirs to 150,CP-S,CP-S,10
3116,41352,then everyone needs to divide their voltage by .0086,CP-S,CP-S,10
3117,41353,we all set resistance to 120 then see the reading on the voltmeter,CP-S,CP-S,10
3118,41354,so everyone divide their voltage by the current,CP-S,CP-S,10
3119,41355,lets try 0.01391 first,CP-S,CP-S,10
3120,41356,just try using 0.09178,CP-S,CP-S,10
3121,41357,lets try setting all of our resistors to 220,CP-S,CP-S,10
3122,41358,then we just divide our respective voltages by that to get our resistance for each,CP-S,CP-S,10
3123,41359,yeah we can break the circut,CP-S,CP-S,10
3124,41360,we should all set our resistances to 0 or something for easy calculation,CP-S,CP-S,10
3125,41361,we can measure the voltage drop with the multimeter,CP-S,CP-S,10
3126,41362,set it to about 70 ohm,CP-S,CP-S,10
3127,41363,now that we have E we can treat this like the last step,CP-S,CP-S,10
3128,41364,so divide your voltage by that value and we should all get it,CP-S,CP-S,10
3129,41365,well there's 120 and use 2 10's,CP-S,CP-S,10
3130,41366,try 220,CP-S,CP-S,10
3131,41367,ok lets have each person increase the resistance until we get as close to 3.25 as possible then the next person can try to get closer and so on,CP-S,CP-S,10
3132,41368,*decrease resistance,CP-S,CP-S,10
3133,41369,bump your resistance up to 330 and we can go from there,CP-S,CP-S,10
3134,41370,lets all try 560 and see what happens,CP-S,CP-S,10
3135,41371,ok lets all go to 680 now,CP-S,CP-S,10
3136,41372,go to 680 guys,CP-S,CP-S,10
3137,41373,I say we just mess around with it like last time,CP-S,CP-S,10
3138,41374,whoever is furthest off change yours to correct it,CP-S,CP-S,10
3139,41375,so we all need to be a little lower,CP-S,CP-S,10
3140,41376,actual math now :/,CP-S,CP-S,10
3141,41377,everyone just solve for your own voltage and we can add it up,CP-S,CP-S,10
3142,41378,can someone try changing their resistor again,CP-S,CP-S,10
3143,41379,try dividing your goal by 0.0171,CP-S,CP-S,10
3144,41380,and then pick the closest resistor to that value,CP-S,CP-S,10
3145,41381,someone move theirs up or down 1,CP-S,CP-S,10
3146,41382,try using the numbers that we found individually because if I is the same throughout the circuit we should all get the same answer,CP-S,CP-S,10
3147,41383,everyone try doing I=V/R with the numbers from your own circuit,CP-S,CP-S,10
3148,41384,see if you get .0086470,CP-S,CP-S,10
3149,41385,"oh, I mean lets try it and see if we get it right",CP-S,CP-S,10
3150,41386,go down,CP-S,CP-S,10
3151,41387,so try and get close and then let me know when you are around and we can figure it out,CP-S,CP-S,10
3152,41388,iowa you go while me and ohio stay and you try and get close then we will take turns we we dont fuck up either persons reading,CP-S,CP-S,10
3153,41389,you lot need to change your vallue and stay there and i will try and get you up to it,CP-S,CP-S,10
3154,41390,we go one at a time and then after each of us have gone we stay if we need to go high or lower to reach the target,CP-S,CP-S,10
3155,41391,lets try having yall go down,CP-S,CP-S,10
3156,41392,aye let's hear it,CP-S,CP-S,10
3157,41393,remember you value,CP-S,CP-S,10
3158,41394,aye peeps right down your answers,CP-S,CP-S,10
3159,41395,We can try adding up all the resistances,CP-S,CP-S,10
3160,41396,Let's try that. Mine was 390 ohms,CP-S,CP-S,10
3161,41397,Lets try it,CP-S,CP-S,10
3162,41398,lets try it!,CP-S,CP-S,10
3163,41399,Lets try hammers idea of IxR0 + IxR1,CP-S,CP-S,10
3164,41400,lets try,CP-S,CP-S,10
3165,41401,Let's try it!,CP-S,CP-S,10
3166,41402,We should divide our voltage goal by the resistor value we have to find the current that is the same throughout the circuit. Then plug in E=IxR0 + IxR1 + IxR2 + xR3. because then we will have the same I value across the whole circuit to use,CP-S,CP-S,10
3167,41403,"Wait guys, for your resistor, calculate what you get for V1/R1 or V3/R3.",CP-S,CP-S,10
3168,41404,and then we should be able to get E if our math is correct,CP-S,CP-S,10
3169,41405,okay now we should be able to plug that value into the E=IxR0 + IxR1 + IxR2 + IxR3 equation and get E!,CP-S,CP-S,10
3170,41406,Was literally typing out if we guess and check enough we will get it hahahha,CP-S,CP-S,10
3171,41407,lets all change our resistances to 270 and see if it tells us we succeeded,CP-S,CP-S,10
3172,41408,so we need to decrease,CP-S,CP-S,10
3173,41409,okay lets use our ohms law knowledge to figure this out,CP-S,CP-S,10
3174,41410,well we'll have to use V=IR,CP-S,CP-S,10
3175,41411,i think we just need to obtain our needed voltage and then do the math for E,CP-S,CP-S,10
3176,41412,get that first then E,CP-S,CP-S,10
3177,41413,try whatever,CP-S,CP-S,10
3178,41414,we need to do this in sequence,CP-S,CP-S,10
3179,41415,go down,CP-S,CP-S,10
3180,41416,raise your resistance a little bit and see where it puts you,CP-S,CP-S,10
3181,41417,so we need to do a reverse process to find the E before its decreased by r0,CP-S,CP-S,10
3182,41418,look so when we find the total E we can pllug it into V=IR to find the resistance that we each need',CP-S,CP-S,10
3183,41419,so now we need to do the math,CP-S,CP-S,10
3184,41420,Let's start with R1,CP-S,CP-S,10
3185,41421,We have to adjust our resistance so that the current increases,CP-S,CP-S,10
3186,41422,So we need to make our resistances higher,CP-S,CP-S,10
3187,41423,To find the current we have to add up all of our resistances plus R0,CP-S,CP-S,10
3188,41424,Ok. Let's all set our resistance to 270,CP-S,CP-S,10
3189,41425,So we have to adjust to each other,CP-S,CP-S,10
3190,41426,Let's try this:,CP-S,CP-S,10
3191,41427,We should settle on a total resistance,CP-S,CP-S,10
3192,41428,"So the way we do it is make sure that as we adjust, all three of us add up to 1000 ohms",CP-S,CP-S,10
3193,41429,Ok. We have to make it to where all 3 of us add up to 100,CP-S,CP-S,10
3194,41430,"Ok. To find E, we need to disconnect all of our resistors and connect our voltmeters.",CP-S,CP-S,10
3195,41431,Everyone set your resistance to 100,CP-S,CP-S,10
3196,41432,do 470 ohms,CP-S,CP-S,10
3197,41433,"Everyone try setting the resistence to 100, that should get us to 4.7 volts",CP-S,CP-S,10
3198,41434,Divide your goal by the current which is .0085,CP-S,CP-S,10
3199,41435,this is trial and error now. Fries keep going up,CP-S,CP-S,10
3200,41436,someone try upping the resistance by one step,CP-S,CP-S,10
3201,41437,add 180 to 680,CP-S,CP-S,10
3202,41438,or add up uor volts,CP-S,CP-S,10
3203,41439,that increased it lets try a different ohm,CP-S,CP-S,10
3204,41440,drop yours one down,CP-S,CP-S,10
3205,41441,drop yours,CP-S,CP-S,10
3206,41442,double click r1,CP-S,CP-S,10
3207,41443,lets all drop to 100 ohms and see what happens,CP-S,CP-S,10
3208,41444,so increase ohms,CP-S,CP-S,10
3209,41445,we just have to do the same thing weve been doing then at the end will add it up for the voltage,CP-S,CP-S,10
3210,41446,bear go up one,CP-S,CP-S,10
3211,41447,now lets find e,CP-S,CP-S,10
3212,41448,maybe divide,CP-S,CP-S,10
3213,41449,try it out,CP-S,CP-S,10
3214,41450,put in your resistance,CP-S,CP-S,10
3215,41451,MEASURE YOUR VOLTAGE,CP-S,CP-S,10
3216,41452,decrease resistance,CP-S,CP-S,10
3217,41453,once we find our resistance we have to find current,CP-S,CP-S,10
3218,41454,everyome set your resistor to 120,CP-S,CP-S,10
3219,41455,look at the power formula,CP-S,CP-S,10
3220,41456,everyome go to 10,CP-S,CP-S,10
3221,41457,everyone go to 100,CP-S,CP-S,10
3222,41458,staay at 100,CP-S,CP-S,10
3223,41459,go to 220,CP-S,CP-S,10
3224,41460,change to 820,CP-S,CP-S,10
3225,41461,starrt at 1k,CP-S,CP-S,10
3226,41462,then we have to take the total,CP-S,CP-S,10
3227,41463,everyoe set to 1k,CP-S,CP-S,10
3228,41464,we are going to have to experiment,CP-S,CP-S,10
3229,41465,so i think we need to keep our resistance at one point and calculate the current,CP-S,CP-S,10
3230,41466,everyone set to 820 ohms,CP-S,CP-S,10
3231,41467,everyone got to 1k,CP-S,CP-S,10
3232,41468,everyone stay at 1k,CP-S,CP-S,10
3233,41469,ok so everyone vhange it to 820,CP-S,CP-S,10
3234,41470,lets all start at 1k resisitor,CP-S,CP-S,10
3235,41471,then we add all of those to find r0,CP-S,CP-S,10
3236,41472,lets try 180 150 120 tim go 180 chris go 150 ill go 120,CP-S,CP-S,10
3237,41473,do 180 and try it,CP-S,CP-S,10
3238,41474,i got 300 so lets try 330,CP-S,CP-S,10
3239,41475,can everyone change their resistor to 1k real fast,CP-S,CP-S,10
3240,41476,one person needs to change theres around util they get their v,CP-S,CP-S,10
3241,41477,then the next person will go,CP-S,CP-S,10
3242,41478,everyone type 15 volts,CP-S,CP-S,10
3243,41479,type 15 at bottom,CP-S,CP-S,10
3244,41480,ok we are adjusting,CP-S,CP-S,10
3245,41481,"every one get a fixed resistor, and one person can change his resistor to get a fixed voltage",CP-S,CP-S,10
3246,41482,can someone change their resistor value,CP-S,CP-S,10
3247,41483,math time,CP-S,CP-S,10
3248,41484,lets try it,CP-S,CP-S,10
3249,41485,somebody change somthing,CP-S,CP-S,10
3250,41486,or any of you change resistance,CP-S,CP-S,10
3251,41487,put 12 in unknown,CP-S,CP-S,10
3252,41488,okay so let's make all of ours 820 ohms,CP-S,CP-S,10
3253,41489,try going down a value,CP-S,CP-S,10
3254,41490,some one bump theirs up one,CP-S,CP-S,10
3255,41491,So someone bump theirs down one resistor,CP-S,CP-S,10
3256,41492,Other way,CP-S,CP-S,10
3257,41493,everybody change it to 220,CP-S,CP-S,10
3258,41494,Everyone try 560,CP-S,CP-S,10
3259,41495,Someone bump theirs up one,CP-S,CP-S,10
3260,41496,use our goal voltage divide it,CP-S,CP-S,10
3261,41497,divide your voltage by the current,CP-S,CP-S,10
3262,41498,Take your resistor value and the voltage on the red thing and calculate the current,CP-S,CP-S,10
3263,41499,hold on everyone switch the multimeter to the amp side for 200MU,CP-S,CP-S,10
3264,41500,try this,CP-S,CP-S,10
3265,41501,Go up real quick,CP-S,CP-S,10
3266,41502,it is ok try 270,CP-S,CP-S,10
3267,41503,alright someone go down now,CP-S,CP-S,10
3268,41504,other way other way,CP-S,CP-S,10
3269,41505,alright go up one again,CP-S,CP-S,10
3270,41506,other way other way,CP-S,CP-S,10
3271,41507,every one check the 20m setting first,CP-S,CP-S,10
3272,41508,every one make there resistance 390,CP-S,CP-S,10
3273,41509,now check the amps,CP-S,CP-S,10
3274,41510,then just plus voltage together,CP-S,CP-S,10
3275,41511,go back to 390 and everyone check ther voltage,CP-S,CP-S,10
3276,41512,then we'll sum all our V's together,CP-S,CP-S,10
3277,41513,ok add them up,CP-S,CP-S,10
3278,41514,just take your goal V and divide by .007805,CP-S,CP-S,10
3279,41515,let's measure the current I and find V,CP-S,CP-S,10
3280,41516,check amps again,CP-S,CP-S,10
3281,41517,"nvm, do 1k and we'll see",CP-S,CP-S,10
3282,41518,"ok, so now like before, solve v+ir for goal",CP-S,CP-S,10
3283,41519,ok so lets try that with ohms law then,CP-S,CP-S,10
3284,41520,So we should use the current coming out of R0,CP-S,CP-S,10
3285,41521,lets work from there then same as before,CP-S,CP-S,10
3286,41522,set all same ohms,CP-S,CP-S,10
3287,41523,and we distributer around until we get our values,CP-S,CP-S,10
3288,41524,so we need to increase our voltage drop total by 2.4 V,CP-S,CP-S,10
3289,41525,someone bump up their resisotr one notch,CP-S,CP-S,10
3290,41526,we have 3.09 total voltage we have to go down by .09,CP-S,CP-S,10
3291,41527,we gotta go down,CP-S,CP-S,10
3292,41528,so someone else drop your resistor,CP-S,CP-S,10
3293,41529,"lets all go to 220, see what happens",CP-S,CP-S,10
3294,41530,so we need to calculate the voltage drop over each and use to calculate our invidual resistor value,CP-S,CP-S,10
3295,41531,so we have to go in order since what ever circuit 1 is will effect the later,CP-S,CP-S,10
3296,41532,we can use that to get a current and then adjust your value to hit that voltage,CP-S,CP-S,10
3297,41533,now we go to circuit 2,CP-S,CP-S,10
3298,41534,everyone set to 270,CP-S,CP-S,10
3299,41535,pick your resistance off of that,CP-S,CP-S,10
3300,41536,someone needs to enter the unknown value,CP-S,CP-S,10
3301,41537,everyone go to 100 ohms,CP-S,CP-S,10
3302,41538,set to maximum resistance,CP-S,CP-S,10
3303,41539,try 1M,CP-S,CP-S,10
3304,41540,"if we all have the same r we should be good (16/4=4), so set em to 150",CP-S,CP-S,10
3305,41541,set it to 150,CP-S,CP-S,10
3306,41542,you can guess and check from there but r1 needs to go first,CP-S,CP-S,10
3307,41543,then r2,CP-S,CP-S,10
3308,41544,"we cant set our r to 0, so just pick 10",CP-S,CP-S,10
3309,41545,so just trial and error and then ill do mine then 3,CP-S,CP-S,10
3310,41546,so we just do some proportion stuff then,CP-S,CP-S,10
3311,41547,maybe just do v across yours to be the thing you need,CP-S,CP-S,10
3312,41548,everyone switch to 450 ohm,CP-S,CP-S,10
3313,41549,sdo we add our resistance,CP-S,CP-S,10
3314,41550,so everyone go to 1000 ohm,CP-S,CP-S,10
3315,41551,increase by one level,CP-S,CP-S,10
3316,41552,now just adjust the resistor until you get 4,CP-S,CP-S,10
3317,41553,so circut 2 adjust the resistor till you get 4 on the multimeter and then circut 3 adjust till you get 4 on the multimeter i think,CP-S,CP-S,10
3318,41554,try a greater resistor,CP-S,CP-S,10
3319,41555,okay try the 680,CP-S,CP-S,10
3320,41556,play around with it and see if you can get to something close to 4,CP-S,CP-S,10
3321,41557,okay now someone else change theirs,CP-S,CP-S,10
3322,41558,let's try to find ones below 1k,CP-S,CP-S,10
3323,41559,okay lets all go to 680 ohms,CP-S,CP-S,10
3324,41560,so we need to go up,CP-S,CP-S,10
3325,41561,everyone go up 1 and ill go down one,CP-S,CP-S,10
3326,41562,"maybe were too close together? ill go down 4, pliers go up 4",CP-S,CP-S,10
3327,41563,let's both go down 1,CP-S,CP-S,10
3328,41564,drop it to 100,CP-S,CP-S,10
3329,41565,Ok lets try this,CP-S,CP-S,10
3330,41566,so maybe yall try 280,CP-S,CP-S,10
3331,41567,reduce ur resistors,CP-S,CP-S,10
3332,41568,just press anything guys,CP-S,CP-S,10
3333,41569,plug the cable back in,CP-S,CP-S,10
3334,41570,keep the resister as 560,CP-S,CP-S,10
3335,41571,or make it 680,CP-S,CP-S,10
3336,41572,register as 680,CP-S,CP-S,10
3337,41573,everybody keep the first one,CP-S,CP-S,10
3338,41574,okay lets go then,CP-S,CP-S,10
3339,41575,now lets try little higher,CP-S,CP-S,10
3340,41576,1K is perfect,CP-S,CP-S,10
3341,41577,lets use that,CP-S,CP-S,10
3342,41578,lets go for 680k ohms,CP-S,CP-S,10
3343,41579,"i know, try 100k",CP-S,CP-S,10
3344,41580,use 18k,CP-S,CP-S,10
3345,41581,DO THAT,CP-S,CP-S,10
3346,41582,flip the red and black cable the negative sign will disappear,CP-S,CP-S,10
3347,41583,33K FAST,CP-S,CP-S,10
3348,41584,GOO,CP-S,CP-S,10
3349,41585,i think we should reduce,CP-S,CP-S,10
3350,41586,To change the resistance click on the resistor thing,CP-S,CP-S,10
3351,41587,"Okay, so we gotta do some math",CP-S,CP-S,10
3352,41588,So let's calculate the voltage of R0 real quick,CP-S,CP-S,10
3353,41589,Everybody set your resistance to 10,CP-S,CP-S,10
3354,41590,Wait no yeah put it on 10,CP-S,CP-S,10
3355,41591,Everybody set your resistance to like 100,CP-S,CP-S,10
3356,41592,Try 82,CP-S,CP-S,10
3357,41593,"Okay, let's try putting it on step higher",CP-S,CP-S,10
3358,41594,See how it changes,CP-S,CP-S,10
3359,41595,Okay so we gotta take it up even higher,CP-S,CP-S,10
3360,41596,Try 220,CP-S,CP-S,10
3361,41597,One step higher,CP-S,CP-S,10
3362,41598,One step higher I guess,CP-S,CP-S,10
3363,41599,"Okay, back to math",CP-S,CP-S,10
3364,41600,Good old ohms law,CP-S,CP-S,10
3365,41601,ya lets get all our info together,CP-S,CP-S,10
3366,41602,Increase the resistance up a notch,CP-S,CP-S,10
3367,41603,can we all put it on 120,CP-S,CP-S,10
3368,41604,"Idk though, worth a shot",CP-S,CP-S,10
3369,41605,Everybody divide your goal by .0080833333333,CP-S,CP-S,10
3370,41606,Everyone recheck their math,CP-S,CP-S,10
3371,41607,Each resistor affects the others so do we need to coordinate and pick ones at the same time,CP-S,CP-S,10
3372,41608,try 560 all,CP-S,CP-S,10
3373,41609,just unhook the battery and probe it,CP-S,CP-S,10
3374,41610,unhook the green wires and connect the red to the left and the black to the right and that will give you the vale,CP-S,CP-S,10
3375,41611,then hook it back up,CP-S,CP-S,10
3376,41612,try 154.1,CP-S,CP-S,10
3377,41613,double click on it,CP-S,CP-S,10
3378,41614,switch red and blue around,CP-S,CP-S,10
3379,41615,change ohms to 390,CP-S,CP-S,10
3380,41616,calculate it,CP-S,CP-S,10
3381,41617,so get a current measurement,CP-S,CP-S,10
3382,41618,then solve,CP-S,CP-S,10
3383,41619,then divide what ever volts you need by .075,CP-S,CP-S,10
3384,41620,go to DCV 20,CP-S,CP-S,10
3385,41621,click on 22 ohms for resistor,CP-S,CP-S,10
3386,41622,divide your goal by .075,CP-S,CP-S,10
3387,41623,so you guys need to change yours,CP-S,CP-S,10
3388,41624,ok so you guys go down a bit now,CP-S,CP-S,10
3389,41625,go back,CP-S,CP-S,10
3390,41626,or up,CP-S,CP-S,10
3391,41627,down 1,CP-S,CP-S,10
3392,41628,go back,CP-S,CP-S,10
3393,41629,ok go,CP-S,CP-S,10
3394,41630,up one more everyone,CP-S,CP-S,10
3395,41631,just click the green wire and put one of the thingys on it,CP-S,CP-S,10
3396,41632,click green wire and put black thing on it,CP-S,CP-S,10
3397,41633,imput in the thing below Chat,CP-S,CP-S,10
3398,41634,so green move down,CP-S,CP-S,10
3399,41635,go back up,CP-S,CP-S,10
3400,41636,go up again,CP-S,CP-S,10
3401,41637,go again,CP-S,CP-S,10
3402,41638,go up again,CP-S,CP-S,10
3403,41639,blue go up one,CP-S,CP-S,10
3404,41640,ok set your resistors to that,CP-S,CP-S,10
3405,41641,everyone do their V=IR. cause V=IR(1) V=IR(2) and V=IR(3),CP-S,CP-S,10
3406,41642,everybody change your risistors to 220,CP-S,CP-S,10
3407,41643,we'll get close again and then play with it,CP-S,CP-S,10
3408,41644,and then each of us will go up 1 and down one.,CP-S,CP-S,10
3409,41645,both of you set your resistor to the same ohms its says at the top,CP-S,CP-S,10
3410,41646,stop where we are right now and say what you have your resistor set as,CP-S,CP-S,10
3411,41647,"Hold up, I'm gonna try to get mine close to it, then the second circuit can go, then the third and we can see if it averages out",CP-S,CP-S,10
3412,41648,so the third person should go and see if they can get it back up to 2.25,CP-S,CP-S,10
3413,41649,everyone go to 390 if that doesnt work go back to how we are now,CP-S,CP-S,10
3414,41650,say before you do partner,CP-S,CP-S,10
3415,41651,Someone else try going up one,CP-S,CP-S,10
3416,41652,someone try 390 470 and 560,CP-S,CP-S,10
3417,41653,Okay try going down another,CP-S,CP-S,10
3418,41654,lets all use 1k ohm resistor and we can just trial and error from there,CP-S,CP-S,10
3419,41655,hook your wires up and turn your meter one space to the right,CP-S,CP-S,10
3420,41656,turn your dials to acv 200 and try and make the number reach 4.0,CP-S,CP-S,10
3421,41657,lets try all making them the same,CP-S,CP-S,10
3422,41658,start at 220,CP-S,CP-S,10
3423,41659,so lets set r1 and r2 the same,CP-S,CP-S,10
3424,41660,and have r3 trial it,CP-S,CP-S,10
3425,41661,lets go to the next one,CP-S,CP-S,10
3426,41662,lets us check well,CP-S,CP-S,10
3427,41663,both of you go to 1000,CP-S,CP-S,10
3428,41664,we all gotta do 330/3,CP-S,CP-S,10
3429,41665,everyone do 100 ohm,CP-S,CP-S,10
3430,41666,Lets make circuits 1-3 and equivalent then voltage divide out to find each resistance,CP-S,CP-S,10
3431,41667,I think we need to use current to solve this. Mine is 18.6 amps,CP-S,CP-S,10
3432,41668,then we can change the resistors to get 2 volts,CP-S,CP-S,10
3433,41669,erry one finna try 560,CP-S,CP-S,10
3434,41670,alright lets do it,CP-S,CP-S,10
3435,41671,Try 39,CP-S,CP-S,10
3436,41672,Try 100 everyone,CP-S,CP-S,10
3437,41673,we can just guess timate until we get because all our resistances have to be equal,CP-S,CP-S,10
3438,41674,Try 330,CP-S,CP-S,10
3439,41675,If one person wants to go ahead and do the math and than tell us what to set our resistances to that might work,CP-S,CP-S,10
3440,41676,Try r1 = 64,CP-S,CP-S,10
3441,41677,so should we total all our voltages and then set that for E,CP-S,CP-S,10
3442,41678,everyine set their voltage to 100 ohms,CP-S,CP-S,10
3443,41679,try it out,CP-S,CP-S,10
3444,41680,"ok, everyone set resistance to 100",CP-S,CP-S,10
3445,41681,"try it, no idea if that will work",CP-S,CP-S,10
3446,41682,Everybody set your resistance to 100 ohms. Now whats your V?,CP-S,CP-S,10
3447,41683,you dont. you change the value of your resistor,CP-S,CP-S,10
3448,41684,we have to change the values of our resistors to get to the goal voltage,CP-S,CP-S,10
3449,41685,go back to what you originally had,CP-S,CP-S,10
3450,41686,we can take all our resistances and do a proportion of the total voltage to find E I think,CP-S,CP-S,10
3451,41687,"if you take out one end of the green leads, and connect in series and then switch the meter to measure current",CP-S,CP-S,10
3452,41688,dont change your r and everyone tell me your v value,CP-S,CP-S,10
3453,41689,put your resistors back for a sec,CP-S,CP-S,10
3454,41690,enter in the voltage across the bottom,CP-S,CP-S,10
3455,41691,V=IR chop chop,CP-S,CP-S,10
3456,41692,alright so I guess we have to find the current through R0 first,CP-S,CP-S,10
3457,41693,i think you pull out the first lead from the circuit and connect the meter into that break,CP-S,CP-S,10
3458,41694,you have to lift up one end of the wire and one end of the resistor and put the leads between there,CP-S,CP-S,10
3459,41695,I think you need to lower the resistance on yours,CP-S,CP-S,10
3460,41696,or...we could avoid the math and put all our resistors at the same R and just check the V each time,CP-S,CP-S,10
3461,41697,just start guessing every value of E,CP-S,CP-S,10
3462,41698,"we should all just start at 100 and see what we get, move on from there",CP-S,CP-S,10
3463,41699,so if you need less than that go down,CP-S,CP-S,10
3464,41700,E = IR and we can use our measured values of E and our resistance to determine I which is constant throughout and then use that and R0 to get E,CP-S,CP-S,10
3465,41701,lets just all start at 120 and go from there again,CP-S,CP-S,10
3466,41702,I think wee were supposed to do that first,CP-S,CP-S,10
3467,41703,mess around til we get it i guess,CP-S,CP-S,10
3468,41704,so we use E and R0 to find R1 R2 and R3,CP-S,CP-S,10
3469,41705,everyone hit resistance 270 and see what happens,CP-S,CP-S,10
3470,41706,so we need to go up,CP-S,CP-S,10
3471,41707,everyone hit 330 because i think thats the next one,CP-S,CP-S,10
3472,41708,everyone try 220,CP-S,CP-S,10
3473,41709,try 270,CP-S,CP-S,10
3474,41710,so we need math,CP-S,CP-S,10
3475,41711,everyone try that. Divide your V by .028 and put in the closest value,CP-S,CP-S,10
3476,41712,try using I as .0106,CP-S,CP-S,10
3477,41713,everyone divide your voltage by .010638 and put whats close.,CP-S,CP-S,10
3478,41714,Someone else needs to change their resistance,CP-S,CP-S,10
3479,41715,lower,CP-S,CP-S,10
3480,41716,someone go a little higher,CP-S,CP-S,10
3481,41717,someone needs to dial it down one notch,CP-S,CP-S,10
3482,41718,someone go up a resistance level,CP-S,CP-S,10
3483,41719,go up,CP-S,CP-S,10
3484,41720,someone else go down,CP-S,CP-S,10
3485,41721,i'm at 180 someone else has to go up,CP-S,CP-S,10
3486,41722,try 220,CP-S,CP-S,10
3487,41723,someone try going down a notch,CP-S,CP-S,10
3488,41724,try going 330,CP-S,CP-S,10
3489,41725,you have to use the meter and its measured in amps,CP-S,CP-S,10
3490,41726,put it on the one that says 10A,CP-S,CP-S,10
3491,41727,click on the resistance and a drop down menu will show some resistances,CP-S,CP-S,10
3492,41728,Try 390,CP-S,CP-S,10
3493,41729,we might just have to go through as a group and each choose the same and go through until we get 3,CP-S,CP-S,10
3494,41730,just trial and error,CP-S,CP-S,10
3495,41731,try 270,CP-S,CP-S,10
3496,41732,I think we have to figure out the total R to get the 3 volts and then mix and match until we get the R,CP-S,CP-S,10
3497,41733,dial should be set to 20 DC,CP-S,CP-S,10
3498,41734,okay let me get to near 2.5 and then you will probably have to go up a few clicks,CP-S,CP-S,10
3499,41735,bump yours up again then,CP-S,CP-S,10
3500,41736,do what we did before,CP-S,CP-S,10
3501,41737,let's try this again,CP-S,CP-S,10
3502,41738,someone try going up see if that works,CP-S,CP-S,10
3503,41739,You two try changing yours now,CP-S,CP-S,10
3504,41740,everyone drop to 10 ohms,CP-S,CP-S,10
3505,41741,put in a random number for E,CP-S,CP-S,10
3506,41742,Everyone calculate their Voltage first,CP-S,CP-S,10
3507,41743,Just put the red probe on the left and the black probe on the right of your resistor,CP-S,CP-S,10
3508,41744,That is step 1,CP-S,CP-S,10
3509,41745,"Ok, what we do now is subtract all of our Voltage's from E in order to calculate V0",CP-S,CP-S,10
3510,41746,just set yalls to 330 and lets play around,CP-S,CP-S,10
3511,41747,Somebody go back,CP-S,CP-S,10
3512,41748,We all have to set our resistors to different settings to reach each of our goals,CP-S,CP-S,10
3513,41749,lets all just set it as low as possible on 10,CP-S,CP-S,10
3514,41750,then we can play w it,CP-S,CP-S,10
3515,41751,we all have to be on the same resistance and keep building until it reaches the goal,CP-S,CP-S,10
3516,41752,everyone set it on 100,CP-S,CP-S,10
3517,41753,GO,CP-S,CP-S,10
3518,41754,try 330,CP-S,CP-S,10
3519,41755,everyone try 390,CP-S,CP-S,10
3520,41756,now try 470,CP-S,CP-S,10
3521,41757,So everyone just start at 10 again lol,CP-S,CP-S,10
3522,41758,so yall wil just have to adjust accordingly,CP-S,CP-S,10
3523,41759,both of you guys lower it to 390 and tell me what it reads,CP-S,CP-S,10
3524,41760,raise it up a notch,CP-S,CP-S,10
3525,41761,We all have different goals this time so the only way i think we will be able to figure this one out is to at least attempt to do the math,CP-S,CP-S,10
3526,41762,switch your red and black thingys to get it positive,CP-S,CP-S,10
3527,41763,HERES THE PLAN,CP-S,CP-S,10
3528,41764,I think the first step is calculating total resistance,CP-S,CP-S,10
3529,41765,EVERYONE SET RESISTANCE TO 170,CP-S,CP-S,10
3530,41766,"Okay guys, let's try again",CP-S,CP-S,10
3531,41767,So do the highest possible divided by 4,CP-S,CP-S,10
3532,41768,Everyone just try to play around and make your thing read 170 A,CP-S,CP-S,10
3533,41769,Try 3.9,CP-S,CP-S,10
3534,41770,Everyone make it 2.7,CP-S,CP-S,10
3535,41771,tr 2.2,CP-S,CP-S,10
3536,41772,lets do 1,CP-S,CP-S,10
3537,41773,Everyone do 1 and see what that gives us,CP-S,CP-S,10
3538,41774,Lets do 560,CP-S,CP-S,10
3539,41775,Try 680,CP-S,CP-S,10
3540,41776,Start high and work our way down,CP-S,CP-S,10
3541,41777,"So this time, instead of saying a specific number to try next, say UP or DOWN",CP-S,CP-S,10
3542,41778,lets all put our resistance to 150 to being,CP-S,CP-S,10
3543,41779,UP,CP-S,CP-S,10
3544,41780,up,CP-S,CP-S,10
3545,41781,Okay. Lets try 1Kohm,CP-S,CP-S,10
3546,41782,"Ok, north lets just run it with us two",CP-S,CP-S,10
3547,41783,"Okay, lets do 680",CP-S,CP-S,10
3548,41784,UP,CP-S,CP-S,10
3549,41785,down,CP-S,CP-S,10
3550,41786,try 560,CP-S,CP-S,10
3551,41787,hmmmm maybe we need to use.....math);,CP-S,CP-S,10
3552,41788,if we add them all up I think we can calculate R0 and then get the current,CP-S,CP-S,10
3553,41789,put the red lead on the left side of the resistor and the black lead on the right,CP-S,CP-S,10
3554,41790,can you guys change the resistance,CP-S,CP-S,10
3555,41791,put all of them at 330,CP-S,CP-S,10
3556,41792,put the resistance at 18,CP-S,CP-S,10
3557,41793,set it to 82,CP-S,CP-S,10
3558,41794,try 47 as the resistance,CP-S,CP-S,10
3559,41795,lets just all try 120,CP-S,CP-S,10
3560,41796,then well go up in increments,CP-S,CP-S,10
3561,41797,go back to 120,CP-S,CP-S,10
3562,41798,try that,CP-S,CP-S,10
3563,41799,go 180,CP-S,CP-S,10
3564,41800,look for 3 numbers that add up to 205 and we can each select one,CP-S,CP-S,10
3565,41801,put it to 20,CP-S,CP-S,10
3566,41802,okay one of you guys needs to lower your resistance some,CP-S,CP-S,10
3567,41803,lets all try 560 ohms,CP-S,CP-S,10
3568,41804,lets try that,CP-S,CP-S,10
3569,41805,look at my board to see the current voltage,CP-S,CP-S,10
3570,41806,we need to find that R first by taking V/I,CP-S,CP-S,10
3571,41807,find I by using R0,CP-S,CP-S,10
3572,41808,you can find I buy using the multimeter,CP-S,CP-S,10
3573,41809,try 12,CP-S,CP-S,10
3574,41810,change it to 12 im pretty sure that is our answer but i could be wrong,CP-S,CP-S,10
3575,41811,change it to 120 i was off by a multiple of 10,CP-S,CP-S,10
3576,41812,i guess just move up to 150 to see if it works,CP-S,CP-S,10
3577,41813,red or green lock in a resistor value and let the other fiddle around utnill we get 2.75,CP-S,CP-S,10
3578,41814,Something lower,CP-S,CP-S,10
3579,41815,Or I guess higher now,CP-S,CP-S,10
3580,41816,someone go up like 10 ohms if you can,CP-S,CP-S,10
3581,41817,"Someone needs to go down, I'm at 3.2",CP-S,CP-S,10
3582,41818,everyone go too 330,CP-S,CP-S,10
3583,41819,go back to the same resistance you had,CP-S,CP-S,10
3584,41820,take your drop/0.012 and pick the closest resistance to that,CP-S,CP-S,10
3585,41821,So one of us just needs to make a slight adjustment...,CP-S,CP-S,10
3586,41822,ok then stay the same,CP-S,CP-S,10
3587,41823,click on the gray cylinder and change the resistance to 470,CP-S,CP-S,10
3588,41824,"right click on your resistor and change the value to 470 ohms, that should be able to do it",CP-S,CP-S,10
3589,41825,so multiply your resistance by 0.00599 to see if it matches your goal,CP-S,CP-S,10
3590,41826,everyone set yours to 100 ohms,CP-S,CP-S,10
3591,41827,then we will all have the same voltage drop across our resistors and can find E,CP-S,CP-S,10
3592,41828,Hook up your multimeter to either side of your resistor- it gives the voltage drop across that resistor,CP-S,CP-S,10
3593,41829,round up if you have to,CP-S,CP-S,10
3594,41830,again divide V by I to get R,CP-S,CP-S,10
3595,41831,take it at 330 again for a sec,CP-S,CP-S,10
3596,41832,keep stepping it up to increase your voltage,CP-S,CP-S,10
3597,41833,"yeah, its voltage. I think if we can guess and check our own voltages to be correct, we can find the current, then calculate what R0's voltage is and then add the voltages together.",CP-S,CP-S,10
3598,41834,change it to 220\,CP-S,CP-S,10
3599,41835,"680, 270, 560",CP-S,CP-S,10
3600,41836,we can tell eachother our current resistor values and voltage drops and we can combine that with R0 to find E,CP-S,CP-S,10
3601,41837,Everyone set to 220 ohms so the drop will al be the same and we can just add them,CP-S,CP-S,10
3602,41838,do the math first,CP-S,CP-S,10
3603,41839,try decreasing each of your values,CP-S,CP-S,10
3604,41844,take your goal voltage and divide it by that,CP-S,CP-S,10
3605,41845,I need you guys to change resistor values,CP-S,CP-S,10
3606,41846,since all of our resistance values affect one another we should have only one person change at a time,CP-S,CP-S,10
3607,41847,everyone put in 10 at the bottom and we should be goof to go,CP-S,CP-S,10
3608,41848,it is everyone just needs to put in 10 E at the bottom where it says unknown value I believe,CP-S,CP-S,10
3609,41849,Put 10V at the bottom,CP-S,CP-S,10
3610,41850,rememrebr your resistnace,CP-S,CP-S,10
3611,41851,try 33,CP-S,CP-S,10
3612,41852,try 47 ohm,CP-S,CP-S,10
3613,41853,getting me 1.98 lets all put that and try and click we got it,CP-S,CP-S,10
3614,41854,Try 15 ohm,CP-S,CP-S,10
3615,41855,everyone try 100 ohm for me right quick,CP-S,CP-S,10
3616,41856,try 100k,CP-S,CP-S,10
3617,41857,try 330 for me,CP-S,CP-S,10
3618,41858,Try 180,CP-S,CP-S,10
3619,41859,just spam answers into it,CP-S,CP-S,10
3620,41860,whoever doesn't have theirs,CP-S,CP-S,10
3621,41861,tinker a bit mine is real close,CP-S,CP-S,10
3622,41862,go up one,CP-S,CP-S,10
3623,41863,try 270,CP-S,CP-S,10
3624,41865,If it's at 7.2 for R0 it means the current is 7.2mA throughout the circuit,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3625,41866,so my res is going to be the lowest of the 3,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3626,41867,so since paper is lowest they need the highest resistance,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3627,41868,given earliers fiddlings ive deduced that we can't go lower than 20 DCV,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3628,41869,we just need to use the calcutor if we did.,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3629,41870,ok so all resistors shoul dbe 390 ohms,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3630,41871,same volatge across each if they are the same.,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3631,41872,should give you your R value,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3632,41873,i think e=7V,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3633,41874,"If they're all 3V, split between 4 resistors, the resistances should all be the same as R0",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3634,41875,I think we all have to enter it before we can continue,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3635,41876,maybe we all need to be over 1k,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3636,41877,maybe because our resistors are so high,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3637,41878,I,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3638,41879,I think we need a bigger distance between our resistors,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3639,41880,"then 14V should be right, because R0 should be 3V.",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3640,41881,i think it has to meet what it says your specific goal is,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3641,41882,152.95 should be our total resistance,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3642,41883,if total resistance is 153,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3643,41884,then there would be 30 left,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3644,41885,ok so if R = 150 then V = 0.73,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3645,41886,if you set yours up right we can click on it and set ours up the same way,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3646,41887,because if yours changes the others do,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3647,41888,peach should have higher resistor i think,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3648,41889,i think we can just make up a e total,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3649,41890,and base our values off that,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3650,41891,i think I is 0.0162,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3651,41892,"ok, so to make 2.5 volts the total resistance should be about 154",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3652,41893,"if mine is 39, the other two r's should sum up to 154",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3653,41894,im still at 0 for mine at the DVC setting so i think that the ohms on circuit 1 need to be reduced so that i can get a reading,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3654,41895,but even if you have 8.2M we should be getting a reading,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3655,41896,is everyones wires connected in. I accidentally was not connected before so maybe that is why no readings are coming through,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3656,41897,maybe if we have the same one it will work,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3657,41898,going to assume we all need .83 again,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3658,41899,E=sum of the three circuits. I believe each of the three individual IRs added together.,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3659,41900,like i think r is our added resistances but i have no idea what e is,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3660,41901,i think its 4,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3661,41902,I think the middle cursiut needs to stay at 150,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3662,41903,i think the middle should stay at 150 and the two ends move up and dow.  if that made any sense,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3663,41904,"if we know v1, v2, and v3, we know what E =, then we can find v0. right, so then how do we find the current I?",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3664,41905,because if you subtract the sum of ours voltages from the total (14) you get 1.15,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3665,41906,I think that all of us,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3666,41907,everyone should be 150,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3667,41908,if everyone has the same goal the resistors should be the same,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3668,41909,We've gotta some math I think,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3669,41910,I guess miss around with the resistor until you get your volts,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3670,41911,i think we need to combine all the boards,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3671,41912,the sum should be 17,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3672,41913,"i think when one of us changes the resistor, it changes the voltage for all of us",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3673,41914,i think it's the voltage,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3674,41915,if i do mu e=ir then i get 1416 at my e,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3675,41916,all 3 should be the same,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3676,41917,guessed 10v,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3677,41918,so i think our i total is .0047 amps,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3678,41919,"all the math adds up if our resistors are 470, 150,390, and 690",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3679,41920,i think i should be 120,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3680,41921,that divided by the resistance should give curent,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3681,41922,so our voltage drops need to add up to 11.13 v,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3682,41923,"I think we use that, put it in V=IR. and alter our R accordingly",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3683,41924,"all the voltages have to add together. if the voltage thru our 3 resis is 2.25, then 2.25V has to go thru R0",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3684,41925,so I think the resistance is supposed to be 220 for all the resistors,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3685,41926,so i think the best choice would be 180,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3686,41927,try 1k if you need .78 and try 330 if you need 2.56,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3687,41928,"look here bucko, im set to DCV 20, if thats not volts than im not sure what is",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3688,41929,Because if we know I and we know each V then we can find Vtot,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3689,41930,If we go one by one starting with circuit one it should help,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3690,41931,"Like if they get theirs, then I get mine, then circuit 3 goes",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3691,41932,"I should have highest R in group, thats all ive got at this point",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3692,41933,So Circuit one should be able to increase now,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3693,41934,i think we find the current by setting out resistors to a number,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3694,41935,"i think because 2.5 is one quarter the total V and each resistor being the same resistance, since there are 4, makes it even",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3695,41936,i think we calculate the current based on that,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3696,41937,and then devide our voltage by the curent to find our resistor,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3697,41938,...we should all have the same voltage right now,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3698,41939,then we can calculate the battery voltage based on total resistance,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3699,41940,if you break it between the green wire and the resistor and put the probes in between,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3700,41941,if we add R0 R1 R2 and R3 we know the battery voltage so we can solve for I,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3701,41942,Wont that current just change though if we change the resistance,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3702,41943,that value would equal the voltage in R0,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3703,41944,Well if we kirchoff the loop our drops will all equal the battery,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3704,41945,if we add up our resistances with R0 and multiple by I we have V,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3705,41946,with target values it will be 0.005,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3706,41947,if we solve for r0 first we can find e easy,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3707,41948,"Oh, if you click on it it changes, got it",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3708,41949,i think our r will be the same,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3709,41950,i think the units may be off,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3710,41951,So mine is last so it won't change,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3711,41952,and then use that i for the whole shabang,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3712,41953,i think it should be each of us at 150 ohms,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3713,41954,i think we can measure the AMP,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3714,41955,then we can find v0,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3715,41956,i think the battery is 13V tho cause if you just measure with the green wire with 1 up you get 13V,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3716,41957,"wait green, why cant you change resistance? if i click on my resistor i can change its resistance",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3717,41958,i think something might be wrong with yours cause i dont think it shold be locked,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3718,41959,"so I measured 4.07V and if the current is 0.009, my R1=452Ohm",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3719,41960,i think we still have to get to the correct voltage of each resistor,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3720,41961,current would have to be 0.0159 for green to have 820,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3721,41962,"Okay, so that means we should end up with the same resistor value.",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3722,41963,I think my resistor value is about 120 ohms.,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3723,41964,I think mine is about 1k,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3724,41965,"Alright. If we all set our resistors to 270 ohms, we should all get 1.5V.",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3725,41966,"if we have 2 circuit that equal the same amount, that will divide the voltage in half",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3726,41967,i think each one have our own circuit,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3727,41968,I think we need to use the V = I*R but idk for sure,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3728,41969,the unkown voltage i thought would be 5.94,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3729,41970,total resistance is gonna be all those combined,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3730,41971,im close but no quite there. My resistor is around 82 and lions should be 560 and tiger 220ish,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3731,41972,"ok total resistance should be equal to 1100, if r0 is equal to 20% of the voltage drop",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3732,41973,It is probably 12V,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3733,41974,"if we all set our resistance to 270, the total voltage will be equal to one of ours * 4",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3734,41975,ok total voltage should be 13,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3735,41976,"Okay, the higher I go the more voltage I get. Hey guitar, try increasing yours.",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3736,41977,if me and piano set ours to  8.2M ohms its basically like nothing is there so horn can just set his to what ever we need it to so we get 4.25v,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3737,41978,When I change it to 4.7m I get 4.54.,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3738,41979,So if you take 8 and divide it by 330 you get 0.024 amps right,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3739,41980,i think we just need to find a common resistor for each of the 3 places but im not entirely sure how to get there,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3740,41981,all of them i think,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3741,41982,I think by resistor has to be between 1K 1.5K.,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3742,41983,im pretty sure if we set our resistances equal to R0 we will all have a 2.5 V drop,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3743,41984,"so if each resistor has 2.5, they all add to 10",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3744,41985,"if you are measuring current, i think in this case you have to use the 10A setting",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3745,41986,Now if we take 0.00965 * R0 (which is 100) we will get the voltage drop across R0,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3746,41987,"if lion meets the voltage goal then i can do mine, since im 2nd in line",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3747,41988,"Because we are all in order, if we solve our resistor in a sequential order, that should work",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3748,41989,"well lets start from the beginning, If I do 1.43 (target)/.0275(A) then I get 52??",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3749,41990,"Well 3.14+6.71+1.43=11.28V, then 13-11.28 should be 1.72V for R0",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3750,41991,I is going to be the same for all of them so it should just be 2.25/680,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3751,41992,Im assuming V=I/R,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3752,41993,If currents the same acrossed all the resistors cant we just measure it with the multimeter,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3753,41994,the v should be 17.009259,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3754,41995,should be,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3755,41996,i think we need 2358.5 ohms,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3756,41997,I think v is 10.37,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3757,41998,that what we were trying earlier. we should be able to calculate R0's v because amps should be the same throughout the circuit,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3758,41999,"Since we all need equal voltage and the first resistor also needs 3.5V, I believe we need the same resistance as R0",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3759,42000,"If i set my resistor to 560 ohms I have 6.9 volts and if its set to 680 ohms, it is at 7.32 volts. my goal is 7.23",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3760,42001,they should all be the same I think,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3761,42002,"if we add ours together, the voltage drop over the first resistor is 11.47V",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3762,42003,so the current through our circuit should be about 20mA,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3763,42004,voltage over R0 should be 4.56,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3764,42005,current should be .0081428A,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3765,42006,"well if they are all have the same resistance drop then they shold be the same resistance, what are you ona?",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3766,42007,i think we gotta do this mathematically....,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3767,42008,guess its milliamps,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3768,42009,current should all be the same,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3769,42010,so 17.6 should hold true for everyone,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3770,42011,I think that means everything should have the same resistance,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3771,42012,That means the current should be 4.87 /  270,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3772,42013,Should be 4.91,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3773,42014,"Okay, then the current should be 4.91 / 270",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3774,42015,"So if you divide your target voltage by that value for current, you should get your resistance",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3775,42016,I got that mine should be about 180,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3776,42017,If we just use the defaults then we can find the voltages for each of us and the current for the circuit,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3777,42018,I think it should be 17 V,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3778,42019,If you break the path and then measure the voltage across the break it returns 17,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3779,42020,Each resistor should be 220 ohms I guess,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3780,42021,mine should be 220,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3781,42022,pot should be 470,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3782,42023,pan should be 390,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3783,42024,the current should be the same idk why its different,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3784,42025,okay explained how to use what we learned last class as a strategy to find the two unknowns,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3785,42026,if thats the current i think the resistance for r0 would be 1k,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3786,42027,Thats the very first resistance that is already given I think,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3787,42028,I think you have to do E=I/R to find I,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3788,42029,so together thats 9.26V but i think we have to add the voltage from R0 also,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3789,42030,if thats what we are supposed to do I got 15.55 but you might need to change yours to 1K too first,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3790,42031,should be 17.94,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3791,42032,if you lot can get close then let me know,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3792,42033,"if then, we have 4.032",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3793,42034,i think we have to change our resistors too,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3794,42035,if everyone divided their goal voltage by .008,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3795,42036,it should be your resistor value,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3796,42037,If that's the case E should be 15.86V,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3797,42038,"Cause we can't find I unless we have E, but we don't know E",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3798,42039,Well if V=IxR We can use I=V/R by adding all the voltage and resistances together and using I=V/R maybe?,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3799,42040,I think it's our best shot right now. I have no idea how else we would calculate it,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3800,42041,"everything should be the same value, so if that's true we can plug that in for IxR0",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3801,42042,If I put it down one then i am under,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3802,42043,i think it represents a resistance thats already on there,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3803,42044,im using a pretty high resistor so if i decrease it or increase it its gonna jump pretty low/high,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3804,42045,if i go up we jump to 5v,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3805,42046,I think E is 8.14 volts,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3806,42047,So R1 should have the bigger resistance,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3807,42048,if i go to 390 i get 4.77,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3808,42049,i believe the sum should be 1000,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3809,42050,so if we add up ours and subtract it from the total voltage,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3810,42051,we can get the voltage of r0,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3811,42052,ok so i think we have to do it one a a time,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3812,42053,if we all have the same voltage we should have the same resistance,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3813,42054,we have to add all of them up,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3814,42055,and that should be Rt,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3815,42056,so if everyone is at 820 resistance the Rt should be 3280,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3816,42057,so if we start with 1k r,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3817,42058,so then we can do what we did last time to find r0 volts,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3818,42059,i think  thats supposed to be r0 resistance,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3819,42060,so our current is 3.86 mili amps i think,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3820,42061,maybe cuz were all trying to get a reading at the same time,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3821,42062,our Resistors prob have to be diff,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3822,42063,well it would have to be total resistance,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3823,42064,it will change every time i change resistance,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3824,42065,i think we need share voltage now then plus them together,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3825,42066,so in theory it should be the sum of all our targets,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3826,42067,if we change all of resistor to150,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3827,42068,thats gonna be 4 150 resistors,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3828,42069,well we should have the same,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3829,42070,"Huh, I think it changes as we all add on our changes",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3830,42071,should be 220 for you i think,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3831,42072,it should be same across all those,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3832,42073,"well according to my current and del V, I should be a 355.799 ohm",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3833,42074,so if we have 6 ma witrh 4k ohm resistance,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3834,42075,should be the 68ohm one,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3835,42076,24 volts was if we used that 4k ohm load,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3836,42077,so if we inch our way up by adding R,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3837,42078,maybe we get to our desired V total with the wrong ohms,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3838,42079,we can find the total resistance we have to reach,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3839,42080,so if i up mine it should reach 4.52,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3840,42081,then we know the total resistance between our 3 resistors,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3841,42082,i think we are supposed to figure out how to get 4.5 volts overall cause all of our circuts are connected,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3842,42083,if anyone changes anything,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3843,42084,it changes everyones values,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3844,42085,"it should by like 560,680 or 820",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3845,42086,"so if R = 10 for all of ours, the Req = 420",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3846,42087,Well if we all change ours that's gonna change,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3847,42088,okay one value might be off then,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3848,42089,that should work,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3849,42090,it should be 9/120,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3850,42091,i think if we all go up one it should be closer,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3851,42092,that shouldnt be true,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3852,42093,ok so if red goes up then me and green go down in volts,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3853,42094,"you guys might need to go above yours, and I might need to bring you down]",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3854,42095,i think im 2 so i go second hawk are you 3,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3855,42096,So on 470 it's 2.15 but on the next one up it's like way too high,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3856,42097,4 came up when we had different ones so maybe two should be the same and another can change it up as a trial,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3857,42098,if Req 150+r1+r2+r3 and i is 8/150+r1+r2+r3 then its just going to give us 8 for v when you use v=iReq,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3858,42099,this one should work,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3859,42100,I think if everybody changes their resistance to 820 ohms we would all have 3.75 V,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3860,42101,bc if it does then we need a total of only 386,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3861,42102,All of the currents should be the same,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3862,42103,oh maybe someone has a break in their circuit so that's changing everybody elses to 0,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3863,42104,It might be R1,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3864,42105,so you should just be able to do goal = (your resistance/ 1.98 kohms) * 13 to find your resistanc,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3865,42106,mine should be at 360 ohms,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3866,42107,mine should be around 290,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3867,42108,Should be 7.15,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3868,42109,i think if we put all of ours to 680 we will get 2.5,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3869,42110,I think were gonna have to have different resistances,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3870,42111,yeah if we have to same resistance we'll have the same voltage,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3871,42112,there has to be a math way to fo this,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3872,42113,"we just enter one i think, like our voltages right now equal 13.06, so if we choose E to be 14, then r0's voltage would be .94",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3873,42114,so I think since the current is the same throughout then if we have the same resistance the voltage would be the same,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3874,42115,i think we might have different once,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3875,42116,think this might be it,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3876,42117,it should be IxR,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3877,42118,the relationship between I and R should be the same for all of them,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3878,42119,Maybe if all 3 of our resistances add up to 470 it will work,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3879,42120,I think once hawk changes we might be good,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3880,42121,Maybe it needs E,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3881,42122,Upping your resistance decreases your voltage.,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3882,42123,I think,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3883,42124,I think when you guys change yours it changes on our screens as well,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3884,42125,I think messing with the green wires is how we change the voltages,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3885,42126,We want our current to be 170,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3886,42127,new theory^,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3887,42128,Haha dont think our strategy will work from last time,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3888,42129,so i think that the setting on the meter should be 20 then,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3889,42130,im the first circuit so I think my resistor needs to be the smallest,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3890,42131,"if we solve ohms law, the resistance should be 60 if we want the voltage across the resistor to be 4.5",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3891,42132,I think it changes based on what each other puts,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3892,42133,btw the goal is to get all resistors correct. we all have a different resistor in the circuit.,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3893,42134,"so red will have the highest resistance, ill have the medium most and green should have the smallest resitor",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3894,42135,"which means I= 0.00957... amps, and we each need ~470 volts on our resistor i think",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3895,42136,if you make your resistance higher it will take up more volts,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3896,42137,okay so if 1.45=120*I,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3897,42138,the current is 0.012083,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3898,42139,"If I got to 82 ohms, I'm at .65, if I go to 100 ohms, I'm .78. I need .69",CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3899,42140,i think it is becasue we are all changing our resistors at the same time,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3900,42141,I think it works it we all keep clicking stuff till we get the right answers,CRF-F,CRF-F,11
3901,42142,"Interesting, the beginning question is the same as the tutorial",CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3902,42143,well we have 4 R,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3903,42144,ok so we know the total current,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3904,42145,and the voltage across 3 of the resistors,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3905,42146,however we don't know Rt,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3906,42147,This time the answer require diffent volts on each resistor,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3907,42148,E is unknow,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3908,42149,damn its different now,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3909,42150,and there's a fourth resistor that we know nothing about,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3910,42151,all of our circuits are linked together,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3911,42152,Are your leads connected to the resistor? All of our resistors are connected to the same curcuit,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3912,42153,each of us have a resistor,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3913,42154,"So the circuit starts off at 13 Volts, an original resistor that we have no control over is at 150 Ohms",CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3914,42155,so same question,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3915,42156,ok so its all the same,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3916,42157,"okay, so i think we are all supposed to combine our boards, beacuse ini the picture at the bottom it has circut one, circut two, circut three and thats like each of us",CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3917,42158,this ones a guessing game,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3918,42159,it should be the same,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3919,42160,each same resistance same voltage drop,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3920,42161,ours need to be about double the next,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3921,42162,then we can increase,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3922,42163,ok so then its like last time. v=ir to get our resistances based on our goal voltages,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3923,42164,adding the voltages is like doing a kirchoff,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3924,42165,ya cuz the circuit is still the same as the last time. resistors in series.,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3925,42166,oh wait no i meant like we should all get the same current in this problem. not the same current as the last problem,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3926,42167,How can it be different we're in series,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3927,42168,Current should be the same in series. Game obviously broken,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3928,42169,All of our resistors added up give R0,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3929,42170,"the current is just a constant tho, right? since we are in series",CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3930,42171,The current changes when the resistance in other circuits are changed,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3931,42172,Got it this one is harder,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3932,42173,All voltage drops need to add up to source voltage.,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3933,42174,Well if we each need a 3.5v drop then R0 needs to have a voltage drop of 3.5v,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3934,42175,It is a series circuit. Have to use total resistance.,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3935,42176,everyone's is different,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3936,42177,they are all linked remember,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3937,42178,okay then the voltage across r0,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3938,42179,we should all have the same current,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3939,42180,That's because each of our circuits affects the others. So when one changes they all change.,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3940,42181,The current is the same acrossed all the resistors when theyre in series,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3941,42182,so the same for all 3. easy start,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3942,42183,everyone has one resistor from the circuit.,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3943,42184,ok we the same there,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3944,42185,all the voltages were the same so the resistances would be as well,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3945,42186,So all resistors have to be the same value,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3946,42187,alright same stuff this time,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3947,42188,"I think we all have the same one, we just submit them individually",CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3948,42189,well it would say complete,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3949,42190,"in series, current is same in every place in curcuit",CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3950,42191,there's gotta be a way we can calculate this,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3951,42192,the current should be the same throughout the whole circuit,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3952,42193,Well anytime you guys change yours all of them change,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3953,42194,wait so it seems all of our resistors go hand in hand if that makes sense,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3954,42195,on thing that we do know is that our current will remain the same,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3955,42196,alright so same thing,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3956,42197,For now it seems to the same,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3957,42198,so now we don;t know E...,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3958,42199,no R0 too now,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3959,42200,"we each have a part, we're in series",CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3960,42201,so i think we all have different voltages,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3961,42202,everyone needs a different resistance and you're trying to find what the resistance across your resistor is so put the red thing on the wire and the black thing on the right side of the resistor,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3962,42203,"when triangle changes anything, it changes mine and then changes circle",CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3963,42204,okay so now we have different goals,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3964,42205,so this is a ratio,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3965,42206,we each have to find a resistance so that eac of our voltage is 4.5,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3966,42207,so this time we have to have different resistance,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3967,42208,"Okay, so we're still in series, so we're all gonna have the same current",CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3968,42209,so now E is 11 and r0 is 100 and we all need different volts,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3969,42210,We each have to change our resistance so that all of us meet the voltage goal at the top,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3970,42211,so we've all got to have the same thing,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3971,42212,we have to all work together to meet our voltage goals,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3972,42213,I am circuit one. I think they want us to change the resistance until we get it right.,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3973,42214,bc we all have the same goal voltage,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3974,42215,its the same problem,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3975,42216,we dont know R0 so its a little more difficult,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3976,42217,Ok so our resistance will all be the same,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3977,42218,so everyone is going to have close to the same values,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3978,42219,it should be the same scenario,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3979,42220,we are all connected in series.,CRF-R,CRF-R,12
3980,42221,same,SESU-A,SESU-A,13
3981,42222,same here,SESU-A,SESU-A,13

5210,43453,what is R0?,SESU-P,SESU-P,14
5211,43454,okay wait soooo our total voltage should be 2.75?,SESU-P,SESU-P,14
5212,43455,so mine should be one third?,SESU-P,SESU-P,14
5213,43456,what are ur resistors,SESU-P,SESU-P,14
5214,43457,alright whats ur goal mashed?,SESU-P,SESU-P,14
5215,43458,okay so everyone is at that?,SESU-P,SESU-P,14
5216,43459,mashed what is the formula to figure out what the split resistance over each should be? do you known,SESU-P,SESU-P,14
5217,43460,is it R1+R2+R3,SESU-P,SESU-P,14
5218,43461,what are your  resistors at,SESU-P,SESU-P,14

5223,43466,what is the voltage drop across R0,SESU-P,SESU-P,14
5224,43467,is V=IR how you calc voltage drop?,SESU-P,SESU-P,14
5225,43468,so we should all have 10????,SESU-P,SESU-P,14
5226,43469,any other ideas,SESU-P,SESU-P,14
5227,43470,mashed are you at 10 ohms,SESU-P,SESU-P,14

5901,44144,Correct me if Im wrong Im just speculating. Resistor 0 drops the voltage .024 so between us 3 we do drop it 1.976 more???,SESU-P,SESU-P,14
5902,44145,how do we convert the .658 to resistance,SESU-P,SESU-P,14
5903,44146,doesn't the voltage drop to 0 at the end of the circuit,SESU-P,SESU-P,14
5904,44147,i think the 0.024 is the current not the voltage drop i think voltage drop for R0 is 0.08 because if you take 0.024 as current and 330 for the resistance and multiply them you get 7.92 and subtract the original voltage 8 a difference of 0.08 so wouldnt that be the volt drop???,SESU-P,SESU-P,14
5905,44148,Maybe 2 of us do 100 and one does 120?? I'm not sure.,SESU-P,SESU-P,14

5932,44175,all ouf our voltages add up to 11 right?,SESU-P,SESU-P,14
5933,44176,how did you find that?,SESU-P,SESU-P,14
5934,44177,you said your voltage is 5.64 and .83 and mine is 3.85 so couldnt we just add all of those up and subtract from 11,SESU-P,SESU-P,14
5935,44178,so .965 volts dropped so 11-that will be where my voltage is at?,SESU-P,SESU-P,14
5936,44179,ok so that means us 3 are working with 10.035 right?,SESU-P,SESU-P,14
5937,44180,so what should I do so I can give the next person my voltage drop,SESU-P,SESU-P,14
5938,44181,how many volts do you need to drop again?,SESU-P,SESU-P,14
5939,44182,so 3.85/.00965?,SESU-P,SESU-P,14
5940,44183,"ok , so how about each of us get our voltages one at a time?",SESU-P,SESU-P,14
5941,44184,so doing that you are finding voltage over R0 right?,SESU-P,SESU-P,14
5942,44185,ok so current for everyone is .0068 then?,SESU-P,SESU-P,14
5943,44186,"but when one of us changes our resistance to get our voltage drop, that current will change from .0068 right?",SESU-P,SESU-P,14
5944,44187,so 11v/100 ohm= .11amps then .11 amps * 11volts to get volt drop right? which would be 1.21 volts .... so 11v-1.21v =9.79volts after r0... so from 9.79volts to lions goal voltage,SESU-P,SESU-P,14
5945,44188,so lions meter is reading 4.42 volts right?,SESU-P,SESU-P,14
5946,44189,why did you do .11amp times 11V,SESU-P,SESU-P,14
5947,44190,wouldnt you divide?,SESU-P,SESU-P,14
5948,44191,what is the unicode for omega?,SESU-P,SESU-P,14

8877,47120,E is 19,SN-A,SN-A,18
8878,47121,yeah 820 should work i think. I added 3.25 3 times and then subtracted from 13 to find what voltage was left,SN-A,SN-A,18
8879,47122,and yeah  valley youre right,SN-A,SN-A,18
8880,47123,yeah,SN-A,SN-A,18

8903,47146,sure,SN-A,SN-A,18
8904,47147,Yea I just thought about that I think you are right Seagull,SN-A,SN-A,18
8905,47148,"Yea, let's try that",SN-A,SN-A,18
8906,47149,Yea that makes sense,SN-A,SN-A,18
8907,47150,Yea.  Im going to hop down some on resistance.,SN-A,SN-A,18
8908,47151,"Yea, 7.02 mA",SN-A,SN-A,18
8909,47152,"Yea, I think that is how we find our E using Ohms law, since our E=IR, and R is just the resistors summed up.",SN-A,SN-A,18
8910,47153,yup,SN-A,SN-A,18
8911,47154,yeah,SN-A,SN-A,18
8912,47155,yeah all of a sudden it went to 0 for a minute,SN-A,SN-A,18

8919,47162,yeah,SN-A,SN-A,18
8920,47163,that's correct,SN-A,SN-A,18
8921,47164,"Right, Presently my voltage drop is 4.2 volts and my resistor is 470",SN-A,SN-A,18
8922,47165,"Yeah, so the with all our voltage drops, the volt drop across R0 is 1.41 V",SN-A,SN-A,18
8923,47166,"yeah measure the resistor with the 2 leads, place them on each end of the resistor",SN-A,SN-A,18
8924,47167,Yes.,SN-A,SN-A,18
8925,47168,yeah mine has changed to 220?,SN-A,SN-A,18
8926,47169,Yeah. All the voltage drops accross the resistors need to add up to 3.5 volts.,SN-A,SN-A,18
8927,47170,"yes,",SN-A,SN-A,18
8928,47171,yes,SN-A,SN-A,18

8932,47175,yeah agreed but im not sure what to do but im bout to start plugging in numbers and screw around,SN-A,SN-A,18
8933,47176,yeah and its 1217,SN-A,SN-A,18
8934,47177,correct,SN-A,SN-A,18
8935,47178,Yeah I got 2.75,SN-A,SN-A,18
8936,47179,ya I got the same,SN-A,SN-A,18
8937,47180,yeah resistor value,SN-A,SN-A,18
8938,47181,right? Were just not given much,SN-A,SN-A,18

8961,47204,That sounds right,SN-A,SN-A,18
8962,47205,yeah not sure about that,SN-A,SN-A,18
8963,47206,Yeah i think they all have to have a volt drop of 2,SN-A,SN-A,18
8964,47207,yea,SN-A,SN-A,18
8965,47208,that part is i think,SN-A,SN-A,18
8966,47209,"Yeah, I'm not quite sure what to do...",SN-A,SN-A,18
8967,47210,I think so,SN-A,SN-A,18
8968,47211,"ah, yeah, my bad",SN-A,SN-A,18
8969,47212,yes,SN-A,SN-A,18

8981,47224,TRUE,SN-A,SN-A,18
8982,47225,yeah and then it would be .68V=100omhs*Current,SN-A,SN-A,18
8983,47226,true i agree with that,SN-A,SN-A,18
8984,47227,"to find voltage drop.........yeah, i think so",SN-A,SN-A,18
8985,47228,yes,SN-A,SN-A,18
8986,47229,"yeah, I figured it would not be precise.  it said I should have a resistor of about 100, 3.14V-219?? and 6.71V-468??",SN-A,SN-A,18
8987,47230,yup!,SN-A,SN-A,18

8991,47234,yes,SN-A,SN-A,18
8992,47235,yeah but if we all get volts to reach we should be able to calculate the voltage at R0 and then calculate that A to give us a general idea,SN-A,SN-A,18
8993,47236,yes,SN-A,SN-A,18
8994,47237,yes,SN-A,SN-A,18

9110,47353,yes,SN-A,SN-A,18
9111,47354,yea i changed it to 1K to see the R0 value,SN-A,SN-A,18
9112,47355,yea we can change it back but how else would we find the voltage for R0?,SN-A,SN-A,18
9113,47356,"yeah, but what is it. like which number would that be on the top",SN-A,SN-A,18
9114,47357,yea i get .00156 which doesnt seem right,SN-A,SN-A,18
9115,47358,yea that is but we dont know I,SN-A,SN-A,18

9277,47520,yeah we have the same problems,SN-A,SN-A,18
9278,47521,yeah but we can calculate it if we all set r to 0 and find the current,SN-A,SN-A,18
9279,47522,ya,SN-A,SN-A,18
9280,47523,yeah lmao,SN-A,SN-A,18
9281,47524,yeah i think so,SN-A,SN-A,18
9282,47525,yeah and its series so (r0+r1+r2+r3)?,SN-A,SN-A,18
9283,47526,yeah,SN-A,SN-A,18

9374,47617,yeah,SN-A,SN-A,18
9375,47618,ok yea so divide your goal voltage by that and then subtract your r0 to get the resistor you need,SN-A,SN-A,18
9376,47619,yeah but i dont follow the math,SN-A,SN-A,18
9377,47620,Yea I know E is the voltage,SN-A,SN-A,18
9378,47621,yea im getting a voltage,SN-A,SN-A,18
9379,47622,yea same,SN-A,SN-A,18
9380,47623,thats correct celery,SN-A,SN-A,18
9381,47624,yeah mine says 11.32 now,SN-A,SN-A,18
9382,47625,yeah they should all be the same as R but we have to figure out what the current is first,SN-A,SN-A,18
9383,47626,yea,SN-A,SN-A,18
9384,47627,yup,SN-A,SN-A,18

9392,47635,yes,SN-A,SN-A,18
9393,47636,yeah me too,SN-A,SN-A,18
9394,47637,yes please save us,SN-A,SN-A,18
9395,47638,yeah mine just went down again,SN-A,SN-A,18
9396,47639,it should be,SN-A,SN-A,18
9397,47640,yeah,SN-A,SN-A,18
9398,47641,yup,SN-A,SN-A,18
9399,47642,ya,SN-A,SN-A,18
9400,47643,go one up more,SN-A,SN-A,18
9401,47644,yeah...,SN-A,SN-A,18
9402,47645,yes but  what is the value of I,SN-A,SN-A,18
9403,47646,yeah,SN-A,SN-A,18
9404,47647,yes by clicking on it,SN-A,SN-A,18
9405,47648,yeah my goal is 4.75,SN-A,SN-A,18
9406,47649,But yes my goal is supposed to be 4.75,SN-A,SN-A,18
9407,47650,yea same here,SN-A,SN-A,18
9408,47651,no,SN-A,SN-A,18
9409,47652,yeah everything is right we just have to find E,SN-A,SN-A,18
9410,47653,yeah,SN-A,SN-A,18
9411,47654,yeah mine keeps changing. it was at 3 a minute ago,SN-A,SN-A,18
9412,47655,Yes.,SN-A,SN-A,18
9413,47656,I think because we are just reading the volts,SN-A,SN-A,18
9414,47657,Yes I think so. And each of our resistances must add up to the total R.,SN-A,SN-A,18
9415,47658,"Yeah, i think its DC voltage",SN-A,SN-A,18
9416,47659,okay yeah mine is at 1.91 now,SN-A,SN-A,18
9417,47660,yeah,SN-A,SN-A,18
9418,47661,Yeah mine is at the max and still says o,SN-A,SN-A,18
9419,47662,yeah it is,SN-A,SN-A,18
9420,47663,Yeah,SN-A,SN-A,18
9421,47664,Should be.,SN-A,SN-A,18

9429,47672,yeah r0 is the same for all,SN-A,SN-A,18
9430,47673,yeah so let's start by having every one measure their current voltage,SN-A,SN-A,18
9431,47674,"Yeah, I see that now. Lol",SN-A,SN-A,18
9432,47675,yEah^,SN-A,SN-A,18

9453,47696,yeah it is,SN-A,SN-A,18
9454,47697,yeah its garbage,SN-A,SN-A,18
9455,47698,yea we all needa have a reading of 1.75 and if we put a voltmeter to R0 that'd have a reading of 1.75 too,SN-A,SN-A,18
9456,47699,yes,SN-A,SN-A,18
9457,47700,"also, yes mine too",SN-A,SN-A,18

9463,47706,yeah,SN-A,SN-A,18
9464,47707,yeah we should just go through them until we get 2.75,SN-A,SN-A,18
9465,47708,that's what ive been thinking,SN-A,SN-A,18
9466,47709,yeah,SN-A,SN-A,18
9467,47710,yes',SN-A,SN-A,18
9468,47711,It is,SN-A,SN-A,18
9469,47712,Yeah it's only giving me the options of 330 and 390,SN-A,SN-A,18
9470,47713,yea try 120,SN-A,SN-A,18
9471,47714,"Yeah, do we all  have the same required voltage?",SN-A,SN-A,18
9472,47715,Yes my current is close to that 0.012064,SN-A,SN-A,18
9473,47716,Yep I'm in the same boat,SN-A,SN-A,18
9474,47717,yes,SN-A,SN-A,18

9479,47722,you right,SN-A,SN-A,18
9480,47723,yeah and im reading that as my out,SN-A,SN-A,18
9481,47724,yeah,SN-A,SN-A,18
9482,47725,"Yeah mines off, I think all resistors have to be the right value before the voltage readings are right",SN-A,SN-A,18
9483,47726,yep,SN-A,SN-A,18
9484,47727,yes,SN-A,SN-A,18
9485,47728,yes 8v,SN-A,SN-A,18
9486,47729,yeah im calculting around 200ish,SN-A,SN-A,18
9487,47730,yeah,SN-A,SN-A,18
9488,47731,no,SN-D,SN-D,19
9489,47732,our voltage and current to get R,SN-D,SN-D,19
9490,47733,you dont need to change resistance value in Multimeter,SN-D,SN-D,19
9491,47734,no,SN-D,SN-D,19
9492,47735,I got 9.73V total,SN-D,SN-D,19
9493,47736,"Actually, no you can't",SN-D,SN-D,19
9494,47737,"Nope, I got .0104 for the current",SN-D,SN-D,19
9495,47738,Nope,SN-D,SN-D,19
9496,47739,Well that's not right,SN-D,SN-D,19
9497,47740,I don't know if that will actually help though since we don't have R0,SN-D,SN-D,19
9498,47741,total voltage shouldn't change,SN-D,SN-D,19
9499,47742,no,SN-D,SN-D,19
9500,47743,"nah, 2.63",SN-D,SN-D,19
9501,47744,not really,SN-D,SN-D,19
9502,47745,i dont think so,SN-D,SN-D,19
9503,47746,nooooooo dont,SN-D,SN-D,19
9504,47747,nah im feelin 68,SN-D,SN-D,19
9505,47748,nah,SN-D,SN-D,19
9506,47749,that aint right,SN-D,SN-D,19
9507,47750,no cuz it hella lowers me,SN-D,SN-D,19
9508,47751,we cant be the same cuz E is unknown know,SN-D,SN-D,19
9509,47752,"naw, too 100 this time",SN-D,SN-D,19
9510,47753,"yall do it yet? naw, 100",SN-D,SN-D,19
9511,47754,nope. cant do crap until we get e or r0,SN-D,SN-D,19
9512,47755,no 1.99,SN-D,SN-D,19
9513,47756,that's not going to matter,SN-D,SN-D,19
9514,47757,"no, it still says 0",SN-D,SN-D,19
9515,47758,nope not it,SN-D,SN-D,19
9516,47759,no we need just E,SN-D,SN-D,19
9517,47760,no,SN-D,SN-D,19
9518,47761,"the last one, yes...not this one i dont think",SN-D,SN-D,19
9519,47762,no u,SN-D,SN-D,19
9520,47763,ok thats definetly wrong,SN-D,SN-D,19
9521,47764,n o,SN-D,SN-D,19
9522,47765,ok i can't,SN-D,SN-D,19
9523,47766,It doesnt work it puts in the 0.65,SN-D,SN-D,19
9524,47767,You have to get a 2,SN-D,SN-D,19
9525,47768,not .22,SN-D,SN-D,19
9526,47769,we have to be exactly at 2,SN-D,SN-D,19
9527,47770,car nooooooooooooooo,SN-D,SN-D,19
9528,47771,"nope, it refuses",SN-D,SN-D,19
9529,47772,i have,SN-D,SN-D,19
9530,47773,nope all the resistors didnt work,SN-D,SN-D,19
9531,47774,yea but along with ours theres an unknown one also in the series,SN-D,SN-D,19
9532,47775,no no stay!,SN-D,SN-D,19
9533,47776,nooo i need to go way higher than 150,SN-D,SN-D,19
9534,47777,yeah but even if youre only .01 off both of us are farther becuase they are all connected,SN-D,SN-D,19
9535,47778,I dont think its working,SN-D,SN-D,19
9536,47779,it was workingfor me,SN-D,SN-D,19
9537,47780,"it is on 180 , thats not the answer",SN-D,SN-D,19
9538,47781,no,SN-D,SN-D,19
9539,47782,no mine is at 6.7,SN-D,SN-D,19
9540,47783,"no, use V0=4.5",SN-D,SN-D,19
9541,47784,no,SN-D,SN-D,19
9542,47785,your value is wrong,SN-D,SN-D,19
9543,47786,150 is not the answer,SN-D,SN-D,19
9544,47787,150 is def not the answer,SN-D,SN-D,19
9545,47788,That's false tiget,SN-D,SN-D,19
9546,47789,i cant go lower,SN-D,SN-D,19
9547,47790,"no, we have to make our own boards 4.25",SN-D,SN-D,19
9548,47791,i dont think i should be at 2.2k,SN-D,SN-D,19
9549,47792,"no, green is 329.82",SN-D,SN-D,19
9550,47793,thats 5.4 not 4.5,SN-D,SN-D,19
9551,47794,not me,SN-D,SN-D,19
9552,47795,only 390,SN-D,SN-D,19
9553,47796,no what i did was correct,SN-D,SN-D,19
9554,47797,nope mine are both on,SN-D,SN-D,19
9555,47798,wait no i had that,SN-D,SN-D,19
9556,47799,nope back,SN-D,SN-D,19
9557,47800,nope,SN-D,SN-D,19
9558,47801,no 2ez,SN-D,SN-D,19
9559,47802,but it still didn't give me the right vallues,SN-D,SN-D,19
9560,47803,Looks like 3810 isn't it either,SN-D,SN-D,19
9561,47804,No your resistor,SN-D,SN-D,19
9562,47805,no,SN-D,SN-D,19
9563,47806,"Guys guessing wont help, theres over 1000 combinations",SN-D,SN-D,19
9564,47807,no,SN-D,SN-D,19
9565,47808,no,SN-D,SN-D,19
9566,47809,r value is wrong,SN-D,SN-D,19
9567,47810,no,SN-D,SN-D,19
9568,47811,i don't think so,SN-D,SN-D,19
9569,47812,no i calculated it,SN-D,SN-D,19
9570,47813,But we need to do it down the line,SN-D,SN-D,19
9571,47814,"No, R0 is 680",SN-D,SN-D,19
9572,47815,But that gives a negative thing,SN-D,SN-D,19
9573,47816,"I don't think either, it's in micro, which is 10^-6 right?",SN-D,SN-D,19
9574,47817,"That's not your resister value, thats the resister value of the resister we don't contorl",SN-D,SN-D,19
9575,47818,"No, across the wires",SN-D,SN-D,19
9576,47819,wrong,SN-D,SN-D,19
9577,47820,no...,SN-D,SN-D,19
9578,47821,no. It changed. I can change it back if you want.,SN-D,SN-D,19
9579,47822,no need total resistance,SN-D,SN-D,19
9580,47823,no .5,SN-D,SN-D,19
9581,47824,no change the ohm value on the resistor,SN-D,SN-D,19
9582,47825,"no 1,2,3",SN-D,SN-D,19
9583,47826,No right now I am at 6.8 and I need 5.71,SN-D,SN-D,19
9584,47827,no at 2.19 need 3.28,SN-D,SN-D,19
9585,47828,no the green wires,SN-D,SN-D,19
9586,47829,"no R0 is the first resistor which is 820, should be at the top of your screen",SN-D,SN-D,19
9587,47830,no i think if our voltages all need to be 2.75 if we times that by 3 we get 8.25,SN-D,SN-D,19
9588,47831,it didn't work,SN-D,SN-D,19
9589,47832,nope,SN-D,SN-D,19
9590,47833,nope,SN-D,SN-D,19
9591,47834,"no, because 11 volts isnt across r0",SN-D,SN-D,19
9592,47835,"the problem is, as soon as one of us changes resistance, the whole current changes",SN-D,SN-D,19
9593,47836,"the problem with that is as soon as we change our resistance, the voltages for everybody else will change too",SN-D,SN-D,19
9594,47837,no,SN-D,SN-D,19
9595,47838,thats no right,SN-D,SN-D,19
9596,47839,nope,SN-D,SN-D,19
9597,47840,calculations won't work. we're each changing the current when we adjust,SN-D,SN-D,19
9598,47841,thats what i thought but poodle has a  pint,SN-D,SN-D,19
9599,47842,how do you mean spaniel that is not possibly,SN-D,SN-D,19
9600,47843,no. set the resistor to 10 ohm,SN-D,SN-D,19
9601,47844,incorrect,SN-D,SN-D,19
9602,47845,no so we have to come up with it at the end,SN-D,SN-D,19
9603,47846,no it's less than one. I got E = 16.999,SN-D,SN-D,19
9604,47847,nope,SN-D,SN-D,19
9605,47848,I just did that ... and the answer is 16.9996 which is a no go still,SN-D,SN-D,19
9606,47849,we did that as well,SN-D,SN-D,19
9607,47850,increasing doesnt get me anywhere close to my goal,SN-D,SN-D,19
9608,47851,that wont work,SN-D,SN-D,19
9609,47852,"nope, just tried to submit that for E.",SN-D,SN-D,19
9610,47853,i didnt think so,SN-D,SN-D,19
9611,47854,but the amps are not the same,SN-D,SN-D,19
9612,47855,nope,SN-D,SN-D,19
9613,47856,"Shouldn't disconnect all of our resistors? If only one of use removes theirs and hooks up the multimeter, we'll have to worry about the other resistors",SN-D,SN-D,19
9614,47857,we won't need to worry about the other resistors because there is no current when the connection is broken,SN-D,SN-D,19
9615,47858,"There should be current if the multimeters are hooked connected, there are four resistors, one we don't control",SN-D,SN-D,19
9616,47859,"but when measuring voltage the connection is essentially broken; no connection, no current. When measuring current it is a complete connection",SN-D,SN-D,19
9617,47860,nope,SN-D,SN-D,19
9618,47861,nope. not accepting it,SN-D,SN-D,19
9619,47862,no,SN-D,SN-D,19
9620,47863,no i have not.,SN-D,SN-D,19
9621,47864,no,SN-D,SN-D,19
9622,47865,nah I just changed the R until i got 2.5 on the multimeter,SN-D,SN-D,19
9623,47866,nah that gave me 0.4 ohms for the resistance,SN-D,SN-D,19
9624,47867,No - R3,SN-D,SN-D,19
9625,47868,pretty sure that cheating but,SN-D,SN-D,19
9626,47869,i did not get 17.6,SN-D,SN-D,19
9627,47870,"nope. i got 0.0079 A, but im sure thats wrong",SN-D,SN-D,19
9628,47871,i didnt,SN-D,SN-D,19
9629,47872,No....,SN-D,SN-D,19
9630,47873,no,SN-D,SN-D,19
9631,47874,that's not mine,SN-D,SN-D,19
9632,47875,oh no,SN-D,SN-D,19
9633,47876,"No, im not at the target",SN-D,SN-D,19
9634,47877,not seeing anything,SN-D,SN-D,19
9635,47878,They don't like like they are when I check your circute,SN-D,SN-D,19
9636,47879,peaches numbers line up for me,SN-D,SN-D,19
9637,47880,to 150,SN-D,SN-D,19
9638,47881,no,SN-D,SN-D,19
9639,47882,i don't think so,SN-D,SN-D,19
9640,47883,well for all resistors we either have a value for resistance or a voltage drop but we dont have both in any cases,SN-D,SN-D,19
9641,47884,"oh, our current changes as we change our resistors, so that current doesn't work after we calculate 14v",SN-D,SN-D,19
9642,47885,nah pot 470 you 390,SN-D,SN-D,19
9643,47886,yeah but there isnt a 140 option,SN-D,SN-D,19
9644,47887,no are all of our e values different?,SN-D,SN-D,19
9645,47888,nope,SN-D,SN-D,19
9646,47889,nope,SN-D,SN-D,19
9647,47890,no,SN-D,SN-D,19
9648,47891,no did you,SN-D,SN-D,19
9649,47892,no,SN-D,SN-D,19
9650,47893,no i think change the resistor to the R0 value,SN-D,SN-D,19
9651,47894,No I think we are still supposed to get the voltage value given to us,SN-D,SN-D,19
9652,47895,no thats just adding up the resistance values i think,SN-D,SN-D,19
9653,47896,which doesnt seem right,SN-D,SN-D,19
9654,47897,nope,SN-D,SN-D,19
9655,47898,its not right,SN-D,SN-D,19
9656,47899,ahhh no way,SN-D,SN-D,19
9657,47900,oh no,SN-D,SN-D,19
9658,47901,no,SN-D,SN-D,19
9659,47902,i dont think so,SN-D,SN-D,19
9660,47903,nope it says its incorrect,SN-D,SN-D,19
9661,47904,"Actually, that doesn't work...",SN-D,SN-D,19
9662,47905,No,SN-D,SN-D,19
9663,47906,No,SN-D,SN-D,19
9664,47907,no,SN-D,SN-D,19
9665,47908,"No, we have to guess the Voltage of the battery",SN-D,SN-D,19
9666,47909,not on my end,SN-D,SN-D,19
9667,47910,no i got something diffferent,SN-D,SN-D,19
9668,47911,no 3,SN-D,SN-D,19
9669,47912,theres 4 resistors,SN-D,SN-D,19
9670,47913,lol nah bro im pretty sure theres only 3,SN-D,SN-D,19
9671,47914,no v/i,SN-D,SN-D,19
9672,47915,but it doesnt read 4.5v,SN-D,SN-D,19
9673,47916,i got 3.39 for current,SN-D,SN-D,19
9674,47917,not 200m,SN-D,SN-D,19
9675,47918,Ours aren't tho,SN-D,SN-D,19
9676,47919,Yea the sums were'nt right,SN-D,SN-D,19
9677,47920,we're not taking account r0,SN-D,SN-D,19
9678,47921,but we also have to account for that 180 ohm,SN-D,SN-D,19
9679,47922,10.5...not 12,SN-D,SN-D,19
9680,47923,"Nah, I got it now",SN-D,SN-D,19
9681,47924,no wait there is nothing near a 355,SN-D,SN-D,19
9682,47925,but thatll just give 4000,SN-D,SN-D,19
9683,47926,"No, like the sum of the goal Vs",SN-D,SN-D,19
9684,47927,no it's 24V minus the V drop of the 1K,SN-D,SN-D,19
9685,47928,"well, it's series, so there is no divider",SN-D,SN-D,19
9686,47929,no wait that has two unknowns anyways,SN-D,SN-D,19
9687,47930,no since the resistor we can't change,SN-D,SN-D,19
9688,47931,no the reading,SN-D,SN-D,19
9689,47932,"i know, but now we know e, we can calculate I",SN-D,SN-D,19
9690,47933,i don't think we can change the resistors freely,SN-D,SN-D,19
9691,47934,but we can't change r0,SN-D,SN-D,19
9692,47935,nah cause when you change yours itll change teh v across mine,SN-D,SN-D,19
9693,47936,nah i'm at 0,SN-D,SN-D,19
9694,47937,i dont think so,SN-D,SN-D,19
9695,47938,nah E=V0+V1+V2+V3,SN-D,SN-D,19
9696,47939,not ohms,SN-D,SN-D,19
9697,47940,no bear did you,SN-D,SN-D,19
9698,47941,no was reading 2.63 on 120 but it keeps changing because bear is :(,SN-D,SN-D,19
9699,47942,680k is too much,SN-D,SN-D,19
9700,47943,no i think we need it,SN-D,SN-D,19
9701,47944,NOOOO,SN-D,SN-D,19
9702,47945,NO 18K LOW,SN-D,SN-D,19
9703,47946,not working for me,SN-D,SN-D,19
9704,47947,NO ITS REDUCED,SN-D,SN-D,19
9705,47948,Nah that's volts,SN-D,SN-D,19
9706,47949,i thought that was the voltage that changed,SN-D,SN-D,19
9707,47950,nah fam,SN-D,SN-D,19
9708,47951,so i don't think that works,SN-D,SN-D,19
9709,47952,nah,SN-D,SN-D,19
9710,47953,nah,SN-D,SN-D,19
9711,47954,nope,SN-D,SN-D,19
9712,47955,not me,SN-D,SN-D,19
9713,47956,"no, at 3.11",SN-D,SN-D,19
9714,47957,no,SN-D,SN-D,19
9715,47958,"doesn't make a difference tho, just adds a negative",SN-D,SN-D,19
9716,47959,it might,SN-D,SN-D,19
9717,47960,nope,SN-D,SN-D,19
9718,47961,"Nah it's too low that way, If I set mine up the next should go down I think",SN-D,SN-D,19
9719,47962,noooo,SN-D,SN-D,19
9720,47963,no,SN-D,SN-D,19
9721,47964,No im just thinking out loud,SN-D,SN-D,19
9722,47965,no 200 ohms,SN-D,SN-D,19
9723,47966,there isn't a resistance less than 10 ohms so sqrt of 1.8987 isn't going to work,SN-D,SN-D,19
9724,47967,Now its not working,SN-D,SN-D,19
9725,47968,I dont think it depends on us having the same resistance,SN-D,SN-D,19
9726,47969,"true, but if the resistances are the same then the voltage drops must be the same",SN-D,SN-D,19
9727,47970,you dont need to subtract the r0 resistor,SN-D,SN-D,19
9728,47971,no the total resistance is the resistance of all three of us  and the r0,SN-D,SN-D,19
9729,47972,i got 0.036 A,SN-D,SN-D,19
9730,47973,Forgot to subtract,SN-D,SN-D,19
9731,47974,I thought you said current was .036,SN-D,SN-D,19
9732,47975,no celery said that,SN-D,SN-D,19
9733,47976,nope,SN-D,SN-D,19
9734,47977,i got .006 as the current. not .017,SN-D,SN-D,19
9735,47978,We cant,SN-D,SN-D,19
9736,47979,that's for voltage,SN-D,SN-D,19
9737,47980,the current would rather go through the ammeter and not the resistor if you did that,SN-D,SN-D,19
9738,47981,"the meter ends have to be in series with the resistor, not in parallel, to measure resistance",SN-D,SN-D,19
9739,47982,no to measure resistance you can put the leads across the resistor like with voltage,SN-D,SN-D,19
9740,47983,sleet go up 1 level of resistance,SN-D,SN-D,19
9741,47984,no it only measures resistance I think,SN-D,SN-D,19
9742,47985,you're going the wrong way,SN-D,SN-D,19
9743,47986,No I am just asking,SN-D,SN-D,19
9744,47987,different equation,SN-D,SN-D,19
9745,47988,nope,SN-D,SN-D,19
9746,47989,Nooo blue you were holding us together,SN-D,SN-D,19
9747,47990,I'm not ready,SN-D,SN-D,19
9748,47991,No I think the meter reads current,SN-D,SN-D,19
9749,47992,Wait thats good,SN-D,SN-D,19
9750,47993,Ik that isnt an option tho,SN-D,SN-D,19
9751,47994,no DCV,SN-D,SN-D,19
9752,47995,"2.2 is too high, were trying to get it to 4",SN-D,SN-D,19
9753,47996,no i am a little confused,SN-D,SN-D,19
9754,47997,i think we are just looking for the voltage,SN-D,SN-D,19
9755,47998,but thats not an option,SN-D,SN-D,19
9756,47999,mine isnt,SN-D,SN-D,19
9757,48000,no bc total resistance is just added up between the three resistors,SN-D,SN-D,19
9758,48001,"I don't think each one of us have to have the same resistor, but yeah we all need to have 2.75 volts drop",SN-D,SN-D,19
9759,48002,no but they do need to be the same,SN-D,SN-D,19
9760,48003,"yes, but to find the voltage drop at each resistor you have to use V=IR",SN-D,SN-D,19
9761,48004,I thought 'I' was the 11 volts,SN-D,SN-D,19
9762,48005,no voltage (V) is in volts,SN-D,SN-D,19
9763,48006,no mine needs to be 3.21,SN-D,SN-D,19
9764,48007,not up,SN-D,SN-D,19
9765,48008,"nah just checked it, thats right. 4.5 volts over each resistor",SN-D,SN-D,19
9766,48009,no,SN-D,SN-D,19
9767,48010,"nope, I'm at 5.08 volts",SN-D,SN-D,19
9768,48011,Not an option,SN-D,SN-D,19
9769,48012,No my left,SN-D,SN-D,19
9770,48013,I cant 185,SN-D,SN-D,19
9771,48014,No its supposed to stay the same I think we got it,SN-D,SN-D,19
9772,48015,8 is power supply we want drop of 2,SN-D,SN-D,19
9773,48016,nope,SN-D,SN-D,19
9774,48017,"Ok, since this is a series circuit we all should have the same current",SN-R,SN-R,20
9775,48022,try both,SN-R,SN-R,20
9776,48023,3.75V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9777,48024,15/4 is 3.75 not,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9778,48025,E is 15 volts for me aswell,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9779,48026,2.79,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9780,48027,3.36v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9781,48028,.71V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9782,48029,So iR0 is equal to 1 kOhm,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9783,48030,My DCV is currently at 20,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9784,48031,so our voltages are total 6.8,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9785,48032,which leaves 7.2 for the R0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9786,48033,Since I1=IT,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9787,48034,So it would be 7.2mA times our unknown resistance to get our given voltage,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9788,48035,R=V/I or V= IR,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9789,48036,Voltage divider rule,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9790,48037,my answer was 466.666 and that was the closest available,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9791,48038,The reason I thought it dis something was because it seems we can all affect each others answers,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9792,48039,Mine is set to the closest value,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9793,48040,0.71 ( my voltage) divided by the current (.00714) nets me 99.43 Ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9794,48041,The closest is 100 Ohms for me,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9795,48042,0.76,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9796,48043,but supposed to be .71,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9797,48044,"since we have 14, if that makes sense",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9798,48045,mine is kinda fluctuating from 0 now so I assume someone is changing their resistance,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9799,48046,because I know E= IxR,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9800,48047,ok so E and R0 is 1.94 repeating,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9801,48048,not rounded it's like,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9802,48049,.00714 A,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9803,48050,we're given all values after all,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9804,48051,"so if your goal is 2.79, your formula is 2.79/ .00714",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9805,48052,I got 390.76,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9806,48053,"There's a 390, but no 391 so I guess just a 390 is fine",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9807,48054,2.43,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9808,48055,.65 volts is my goal,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9809,48056,mine is 3.57V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9810,48057,The sum of ours is 6.65,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9811,48058,0.00243,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9812,48059,We don't have the Vs tho,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9813,48060,i get negative numbers or 0.  I am lost.,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9814,48061,i currently have 2.0volts with a 180 ohm resistor,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9815,48062,"Okay, so now my voltage reading is 0 with the 180 ohm resistor",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9816,48063,this will be  easier if we had the current,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9817,48064,we only have total voltage and R0 and our assigned resistor,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9818,48065,Okay. So i am still not getting a value.,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9819,48066,my goal is to make my voltage 3.5.   but I can't get it.  I do not know what the resistor should be.,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9820,48067,I got the same goal,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9821,48068,"When i first started, I had a voltage reading and I no longer have anything no matter how I adjust the resistance value",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9822,48069,it's the same,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9823,48070,3.5V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9824,48071,3.5*4=14.   14 is total voltage.,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9825,48072,i'm still having the same issue as i said before.,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9826,48073,If I keep resistor value aroung 470 ohm,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9827,48074,it gives me 1.56v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9828,48075,i got 1.46 at  270 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9829,48076,i got 1.51,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9830,48077,390 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9831,48078,"it did that too me too, i just ha to wait alittle",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9832,48079,I am getting 1.45 v @390,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9833,48080,it keeps changing,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9834,48081,but 390+390=780,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9835,48082,and Ro is 560,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9836,48083,this thing is broken,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9837,48084,it doesnt even fully add up to 6 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9838,48085,REALLY NOTHING IS WORKIND AT MY END,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9839,48086,mine is 4.25 as well,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9840,48087,Mine is 4.25 V as well,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9841,48088,1.5V needed,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9842,48089,My goal is 3.83V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9843,48090,My is 1.02 V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9844,48091,they add up to 6.35V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9845,48092,so the voltage across R0 is 4.65,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9846,48093,so the current is just 4.65/680,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9847,48094,so mine is 220,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9848,48095,mine is 560,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9849,48096,Mine is 150,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9850,48097,my goal voltage is 4.76V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9851,48098,Mine voltage goal is 3.92 V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9852,48099,mine is 1.05v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9853,48100,so 9.57v total,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9854,48101,I got 9.73 V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9855,48102,2.11V at 330ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9856,48103,mine is 2.49v at 390 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9857,48104,this will give us e,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9858,48105,2.75V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9859,48106,2.75,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9860,48107,2.75,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9861,48108,11V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9862,48109,so E is 11V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9863,48110,so the current needs to be1.27V/180ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9864,48111,so you can solve for your R value,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9865,48112,A=.0666,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9866,48113,mine would be 150,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9867,48114,so current needs to be .007,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9868,48115,mines 680,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9869,48116,mines 150,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9870,48117,I got 560,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9871,48118,ok my current values are 560ohms and 1.77V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9872,48119,mine are 470ohms and 1.49V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9873,48120,ok the total current is 14.6A atm,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9874,48121,R0=Rt-(R1+R2+R3),SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9875,48122,V=It+Rt,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9876,48123,ok then the R0 is 180ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9877,48124,7V 180ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9878,48125,mine is 1.64v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9879,48126,3.46,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9880,48127,mine is 1.14,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9881,48128,so total is 6.24V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9882,48129,My goal is 3V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9883,48130,My goal is also 3V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9884,48131,My goal is 3V as well,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9885,48132,which is 560ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9886,48133,My goal is 1.97 V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9887,48134,My goal is 2.89V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9888,48135,My goal is .78V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9889,48136,My goal is 10.4V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9890,48137,My goal is 2.29V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9891,48138,My goal is 3.43,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9892,48139,My resistor is at 220ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9893,48140,My resistor is at 1k ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9894,48141,Mine is at 330,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9895,48142,The total voltage,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9896,48143,So the circuit current is .0127A,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9897,48144,And then that current multiplied by R0 is V0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9898,48145,Then E = V0 + V1 + V2 + V3,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9899,48146,My goal is 3.49,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9900,48147,Lol 4.13,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9901,48148,Mine is 2.33,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9902,48149,At 560 ohms I am at 4.22,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9903,48150,Was,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9904,48151,I was just at 4.13,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

9962,48209,about .003,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9963,48210,i got .0106 amps,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9964,48211,the voltage drop for R0 is 8.7V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

9972,48219,now it's 3.92V over 470 Ohm,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9973,48220,my resistor is at 150 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9974,48221,my is 270 ohm resistor,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9975,48222,mine is at 680 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9976,48223,150,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9977,48224,the current across the entire circuit is 0.0916666666A,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9978,48225,we had that,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9979,48226,the formula is R = R1 + R2 + R3,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9980,48227,v=ir,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9981,48228,mine is 2.64,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9982,48229,mine is 2.74,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9983,48230,2.62,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9984,48231,wait mine is 2.62 now too,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9985,48232,2.62,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9986,48233,rn 100,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9987,48234,so out total resistance is 120+120+100+whatever mashed has,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9988,48235,plus R0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9989,48236,so R0 = 120,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9990,48237,mine is 100,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9991,48238,okay so our total resistance rn is 440,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9992,48239,and thats giving us 3 v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9993,48240,so wait if the totT VOLTAGE IS 11v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9994,48241,and then the first resistance is 120,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9995,48242,i = .01966 a,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9996,48243,and v=ir,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9997,48244,so 3=.01966r,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9998,48245,so 153,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
9999,48246,and we already have 120,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10000,48247,33,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10001,48248,add up the resistors in series,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10002,48249,there,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10003,48250,current is the same through each resistor in a series,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10004,48251,so total resistance is 2200,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10005,48252,thats really high,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10006,48253,there,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

10351,48598,0.01,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10352,48599,to make the voltage 2 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10353,48600,"Mine was set E= 8 volts, R0=120 and the goal is 2 volts",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10354,48601,I think someone's resistor is not connected,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10355,48602,thats what i have i think,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10356,48603,but my screen is not showing 2,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10357,48604,my voltage is showing 0 so i dont think im getting because the values are getting higher,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10358,48605,ok mines only at 560 right now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10359,48606,the multimeter for me is measuring at 0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10360,48607,resistor is 2.2k and multimeter is set at 20k reading 2.20,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10361,48608,it is reading 22 for me at 200 k and 1 at 20 k,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10362,48609,so we have to be lower than 2,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10363,48610,to add up to 2 for all of us together/,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10364,48611,i got 002 without decimal places,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10365,48612,ok so we cant set the multimeter at 20k or 200k,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10366,48613,cuz thts ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10367,48614,Im not getting any reading as well,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10368,48615,my ohms are set at 10,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10369,48616,i think 8.2 M is higher up on the scale maybe going down,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10370,48617,and i m getting a reading of 2,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10371,48618,i am currently at 10,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

10537,48784,68 gives me 1.96,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10538,48785,but as you all move your resistance mine changes as well,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10539,48786,so now its 1.58,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10540,48787,it is,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10541,48788,all the numbers on the resistor should all be the same,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10542,48789,"82 right now, but will have to move if we all go to it",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10543,48790,"at 120, mine reads 1.91",SSI-O,SSI-O,21

10792,49039,my goal is 4.5,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10793,49040,k so all our resistors are the same,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10794,49041,r0 is 3.5 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10795,49042,4.5 x 3 = 13.5,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10796,49043,et = 18,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10797,49044,18-13.5 = 3.5,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10798,49045,r0=3.5,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10799,49046,all our goals are 4.5,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10800,49047,3.5/120 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

10803,49050,617,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10804,49051,RT = 617,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10805,49052,ok im on 150 ohms',SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10806,49053,150,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10807,49054,okay mines is 4.74,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10808,49055,it was 4.5,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10809,49056,180 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10810,49057,150 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10811,49058,ok im at 5.14,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10812,49059,im on 180 ohms but my meter is saying 5.4,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10813,49060,5.14 now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10814,49061,5.68 now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10815,49062,it wnet down to 4.0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10816,49063,and on 120 ohns,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10817,49064,im on 120 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10818,49065,was giving me RT of 1.65,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10819,49066,okay the goal is 5.6,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10820,49067,617,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10821,49068,my goal is 1.5,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10822,49069,2.7,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10823,49070,mines is 5.6 volt,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10824,49071,gives us V of R0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10825,49072,I got 120,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10826,49073,1.5+2.7+5.6,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10827,49074,9.8,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10828,49075,9.8,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10829,49076,strange number,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10830,49077,1.2 =r0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10831,49078,1.2/120,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10832,49079,.01 A,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10833,49080,IT = .01,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10834,49081,RT = 1100 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10835,49082,our 3 will equal 980,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10836,49083,their not the same tho,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10837,49084,mine R is 270,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10838,49085,last two R is 710,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10839,49086,ur Resistance is 150,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10840,49087,im 1.67v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10841,49088,5.15,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10842,49089,2.05,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10843,49090,so our 3 = 8.87,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10844,49091,we dont know ET or Rv,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10845,49092,ET = 10v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10846,49093,so 1.13v is R0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10847,49094,IT= .00753333333,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10848,49095,my R is 220,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10849,49096,cant move the fuck on,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10850,49097,unkown value,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10851,49098,need 4.5V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10852,49099,need 4.5v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10853,49100,goal is 4.5v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10854,49101,4.5,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10855,49102,so we all have 4.5,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10856,49103,Et is 18 Volt,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10857,49104,"if we add up all our goal volts, it adds up to 13.5",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10858,49105,we subtract 13.5 from 18,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10859,49106,and get 4.5,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10860,49107,that 4.5 is R0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10861,49108,so every resistor in this circuit has a voltage of 4.5,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10862,49109,"since R0 is 1000 Ohms and all our resistors are the same value, all our resistors are 1000 Ohms",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10863,49110,goal is 3.73 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10864,49111,need .8 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10865,49112,1.8,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10866,49113,R0 is .66V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10867,49114,current is 6.6 mA,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10868,49115,current is .0066 to put in calculator,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
10869,49116,1.67V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

11001,49248,2.25,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11002,49249,that means that the voltage drop thru R0 = 1.75,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11003,49250,so I = .00795454 A,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11004,49251,The R came out to be 282.857,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

11007,49254,I need .85 V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11008,49255,my goal is 5.8,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11009,49256,11 volts is the EMF of the battery. I divided that by E0 to get I0 and I is the same for the whole current,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11010,49257,aight i think i got mine,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11011,49258,i got my R to be 46.36,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11012,49259,that's what I was wondering,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11013,49260,I got 25.5,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11014,49261,so I chose 27 from the list,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11015,49262,i chose 47,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11016,49263,175.5,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11017,49264,okay so 5.8/.033,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11018,49265,turns out to be 174 ish but close enough,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11019,49266,that was i have selected,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11020,49267,check this:,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11021,49268,i like double checked everyone's math and got the same answers,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11022,49269,so voltage drop across R0 is 2.82 V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11023,49270,I got I = .0085454 A,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11024,49271,Yes,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11025,49272,okay so E=11 R0=330 and voltage 5.8,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11026,49273,aight my resistance turned out to be 179 ohms so i chose 180 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11027,49274,Gucci. mine was 100,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11028,49275,I got 678.73 for you red,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

11251,49498,So dont we have to report our R's on our resistors,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11252,49499,v on r0 is 2.65,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11253,49500,2.65/270,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11254,49501,this is at the indicated values for v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11255,49502,And then we could find the current using V=IR0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11256,49503,And then since current is the same in series we could all just do V=IR knowing V from the problem and I from that solvr,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11257,49504,my r was 330,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11258,49505,including R0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11259,49506,to find the r use this 0.009814814814814816               for I then v/i,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11260,49507,v=4.68,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11261,49508,V=2.13,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11262,49509,6.66,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11263,49510,at -5.74 V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11264,49511,I got a reading of 16.24,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11265,49512,.01624 A,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11266,49513,I was just going to do V=IR where I was 16.24 and R was 4R0 since we are all at R0 as our values,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11267,49514,my v=4.75,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11268,49515,Oh that is faster so that means the E is 4.75*4,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11269,49516,So E is 19,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11270,49517,goal voltage,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11271,49518,I just did the math on (390x4)x0.01624 = 25.334,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11272,49519,6.66,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11273,49520,Peach you need 330,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11274,49521,Plum you need 470,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11275,49522,4.68,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11276,49523,i need 3.25,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11277,49524,3.25 here,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11278,49525,I'm already 470,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11279,49526,or 820 i guess,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11280,49527,giving me 6.49 with 820,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11281,49528,i was 820k whoops,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11282,49529,from what was left i divided by the r0 to find the current and then divided that by 3.25 and got 820,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11283,49530,3.34,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11284,49531,2.77,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11285,49532,4.83,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11286,49533,i think I'm 683,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11287,49534,i need 4.97,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11288,49535,1.94,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11289,49536,I need 1.34,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11290,49537,0.85,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11291,49538,1.28,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11292,49539,5.81,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11293,49540,I'm trying,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11294,49541,i have no voltage right now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11295,49542,i think thats part of the plan,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11296,49543,I was trying to find current but my ameter isn't working,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11297,49544,i think its a 9 volt battery,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11298,49545,current is 0.007,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11299,49546,so 0.007 time 150,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11300,49547,plug it in it accepted mine,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11301,49548,plus all our volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11302,49549,okay so now that we know current we can all find our respective resisntaces,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11303,49550,pretty sure ive got mine,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11304,49551,v0 is .75,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11305,49552,voltage at R0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11306,49553,0.75/150,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11307,49554,gives current 0.005,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11308,49555,i got current to be 0.007...,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11309,49556,that was with our orignal values,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11310,49557,Mountain should be like 1k,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11311,49558,4.84,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11312,49559,10,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11313,49560,1.24,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11314,49561,10.18***,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11315,49562,starting at 4.84,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11316,49563,with a 330 ohm resistor,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11317,49564,2.43 with 180 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11318,49565,im at 9.16 volts with a resistor of 680,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11319,49566,V = 4.45 R= 330 I = 0.0135,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11320,49567,(16.04 + E) / (1190 + R0) = 0.0135,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11321,49568,im at 820 ohms now and 10.05 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11322,49569,2.21 V at 180 ohm,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11323,49570,V = 4.05 R = 330 A = 0.0123,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11324,49571,(16.31 + E) / (1330 + R0) = 0.0123,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11325,49572,so i got r0 to be 225 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11326,49573,are we allowed to use paper for this??? i would need paper to do a system,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11327,49574,R0 = (E - 0.05)/ 0.123,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11328,49575,alright well i got r0 to be 20.83,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11329,49576,which makes our voltage a whop[ping 0.305,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11330,49577,and my voltage is 19,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11331,49578,so we know E is 19 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11332,49579,its 220 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11333,49580,19 volts and 220 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11334,49581,I got 0.0125 amps,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11335,49582,.0125 sounds better,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11336,49583,okay cool 0.0125,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11337,49584,our goal is the same,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11338,49585,im r1 and im trying to get 3.75,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11339,49586,Im R3 and I'm trting to get the same,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11340,49587,3.75,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11341,49588,Or the voltage,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11342,49589,i think we are controlling the resistance,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11343,49590,resistance is the only thing I can change,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11344,49591,i got 2.2 amps,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11345,49592,So thats constant,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11346,49593,ok so we know v = 15. and r0 = 680,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11347,49594,But that would go up..,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11348,49595,"i thought that series circuts, the total resistance is the sum of all the r",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11349,49596,15 = (2.2)(680 + R1 + r2 + r3),SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11350,49597,"So, 15/2.2-680 =3R",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11351,49598,i tried micro and the number was to big,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11352,49599,i thought current was suppose to be constant haha,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11353,49600,well it was 2.2 and now i get 5.4,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11354,49601,"I', gettig 1.81",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11355,49602,"Ok, my current just changed",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11356,49603,and amps is staying the same,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11357,49604,But maybe it changes by the resisters before us,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11358,49605,R0 is set,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11359,49606,"oh shoot, we can calculate r",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11360,49607,15 = I 680,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11361,49608,But that needs to change for each one too,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11362,49609,So 15/680 for the first one,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11363,49610,so i across r0 is .022,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11364,49611,i need 3.75,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11365,49612,so R1 is 160,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11366,49613,170,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11367,49614,it doesnt have an option for that,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11368,49615,after he has set his resister,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11369,49616,"They*, I guesss we shouldn't asume",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11370,49617,With the multimeter set to 20m and the leads on the green wire,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11371,49618,"Alright, the  14.42*R1=.022",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11372,49619,That seems crazy small,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11373,49620,13.01,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11374,49621,with my resistor = 6.8kohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11375,49622,So I'm meassuring 2.56 volts coming in,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11376,49623,So 2.56=.022*R,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11377,49624,So mine would be 116,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11378,49625,ok i got the popup message,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11379,49626,4.5 V here too,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11380,49627,4.5 here too,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11381,49628,I though R0 was the resistance of the board,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11382,49629,Mine is at 39 right now.,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11383,49630,im at 82,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11384,49631,im at 56 now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11385,49632,Im at 33,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11386,49633,i see 4.5 V on my screen,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11387,49634,now 4.1 agaon,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11388,49635,I have 4.1 too,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11389,49636,Im at 2.42,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11390,49637,my thing is set to 200 DCV,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11391,49638,3.8V here,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11392,49639,3.76 V now for me,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11393,49640,Mine just went down to 3.5,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11394,49641,4.2 here,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11395,49642,"Mine was 4.2, now it's 4",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11396,49643,im at 56 ohm now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11397,49644,Im at 4.4 rn,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11398,49645,Im was at 82 already,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11399,49646,im at 82 now and have 4.3V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11400,49647,im at 100 now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11401,49648,4.5 here,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11402,49649,Ayy! 4.5,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11403,49650,So I need 2.96 Volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11404,49651,i need 1.98V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11405,49652,Mine is 3.62,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11406,49653,im using 180 and im at 2.02V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11407,49654,I'm at 180 and have 2.62,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11408,49655,"Ok, so I need 0.56 V",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11409,49656,i need 0.67V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11410,49657,I need 2.18,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11411,49658,R2,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11412,49659,im R1 and im sitting at 82 ohm,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11413,49660,R3 at 150 ohm and .83V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11414,49661,R2 sitting at 390 ohm and 2.14 V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11415,49662,now im sitting at 100 ohm and at 0.55V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11416,49663,R1 at 150 ohm and 0.75V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11417,49664,150 ohm and .75v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11418,49665,Im at 470 and 2.36 ohm,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11419,49666,i thought E=V(r0)+V(r1)+...,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11420,49667,I was trying to find the current,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11421,49668,I think it is 7.02,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11422,49669,Mine is 7.98,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11423,49670,R1 at 120 ohm and 0.68 V (need 0.67V),SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11424,49671,I was at 2.21 and I need 2.18,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11425,49672,im at 8 current if that means anything,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11426,49673,im at 0.69V now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11427,49674,anything i change goes up by alot,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11428,49675,"Awesome, Now eagle can go",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11429,49676,im at 120,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11430,49677,68 Ohms here,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11431,49678,im at 100 now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11432,49679,Oh dang im at 330,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11433,49680,i feel like eagle has the most space to change,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11434,49681,Im 390,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11435,49682,R1 120,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11436,49683,I'm at 100,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11437,49684,I need 3.5V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11438,49685,i need 3.5 V too,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11439,49686,3.5 is what i need as well,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11440,49687,I have 3.45 rn,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11441,49688,i got 3.5 too,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11442,49689,2.36V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11443,49690,mine is 1.33 now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11444,49691,0.91,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11445,49692,that means R0 has 3.4V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11446,49693,I = 0.006,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11447,49694,ive got 1.33,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11448,49695,0.89V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11449,49696,my goal is 4.99,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11450,49697,2.94,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11451,49698,when i remove one end of the green wire and test it it says 13.00V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11452,49699,I have 0 currently,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11453,49700,v1+v2+v3 = 8.82,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11454,49701,i got 7.47A,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11455,49702,mine is at 0 again,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11456,49703,i think mine says 5.7A,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11457,49704,mine says 5.08,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11458,49705,mine is at 0 right now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11459,49706,or else the multimeter will be in parallel with the resistor,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11460,49707,mine keeps flashing 5.44 for a second but then it goes back to 0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11461,49708,my voltage drop is 5.73V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11462,49709,so 4.18V drops at R0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11463,49710,Im at 1k ohms with 4.96V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11464,49711,mine is at 636Ohm at 0.009A and 5.73V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11465,49712,i think the person who needs .89 needs a 100 ohm and the person who needs a 4.99 needs a 560 ohm,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11466,49713,problem is that you cannot change the resistance,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11467,49714,at 560 ohm i have 3.34V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11468,49715,at 636Ohm i got 5.73V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11469,49716,to get 0.89V i need to reduce the current down to,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11470,49717,0.0014Amp,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11471,49718,so V0 = 0.657V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11472,49719,thats weird. i can change mine too,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11473,49720,maybe yours is locked for this part,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11474,49721,grey red brown gold,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11475,49722,youre 820 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11476,49723,so I=0.00109,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11477,49724,so I = 0.005,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11478,49725,cuz my V1 is 4.07V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11479,49726,i lied dont listen to me,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11480,49727,when i did 2.94/0.005 i got 588,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11481,49728,so the closest is 560,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11482,49729,V0= 2.35V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11483,49730,i should be around 1k ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11484,49731,i think something might be wrong with greens that it cant change cause i dont see a way this can work with green at 820,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11485,49732,so we is the situation,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11486,49733,"my resistance is set. therefore, my voltage drop is set",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11487,49734,current is constant,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11488,49735,so that mine drop to 0.89V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11489,49736,My goal is to get 2.5 volts. I'm assuming that means voltage drop.,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11490,49737,Hello team I have a goal of 2.5 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11491,49738,mine is 2.5 as well,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11492,49739,Mine is 330 ohms with a drop of 2.95 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11493,49740,"So, the sum of the voltage drops is equal to the source voltage. 3x2.5 equals 7.5. 10-7.5 equals a 2.5 voltage drop on R0. So, all resistor values should be the same then",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11494,49741,"Okay, my goal this time is to make my voltage drop 0.62 volts",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11495,49742,My goal is 5.19 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11496,49743,my goal is 078 v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11497,49744,I got 5.22 mA,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11498,49745,"Okay, this is going to be harder now. I have a volt drop of 4.1 v",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11499,49746,my voltage drop is .87 v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11500,49747,My goal is 4.88 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11501,49748,My multimeter isn't working or is actually reading 0. Presently my R is 150 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11502,49749,1.82 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11503,49750,my voltage has a zero reading,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11504,49751,my resistor is at 68 ohms and i have a voltage drop of .85,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11505,49752,my goal is .87,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11506,49753,I have a 144 ohm resistor on my board,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11507,49754,"E=14, R0=560, R1=55",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11508,49755,rs=144,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11509,49756,You have to measure it with the meter.,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11510,49757,R2= 54.4,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11511,49758,E=14 v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11512,49759,so my new resistor value is 56 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11513,49760,e=14 v R0= 560 ohms R3=56 Ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11514,49761,Mine is still 55,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11515,49762,Vdrop1=9.638,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11516,49763,i have a voltage drop of 2.28 v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11517,49764,my current is 12.39 A,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11518,49765,Lol I have 10.4mA,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11519,49766,ocean i can see your circuit,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11520,49767,my resistance went back to 144,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11521,49768,my voltage drop went back to 2.28v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11522,49769,"In the real world, breaking the circuit shouldn't change resistance of a resitor",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11523,49770,my voltage drop (180 ohm resistor) is 1.87,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11524,49771,so I found out we can change our resistor values,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11525,49772,we can change it to what we need to get our volatage 3.5v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11526,49773,157 ohm,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11527,49774,"Currently, R1=72.6",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11528,49775,R2 = 137.7,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11529,49776,so R0 has a volt drop of .025 v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11530,49777,becuase 14v/560 is .025,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11531,49778,becuase 14v/4 =3.5v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11532,49779,ok. I'm 560 ohms now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11533,49780,i am at 560 ohm as well,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

11540,49787,8.02V TOTAL,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11541,49788,That means that R0 goal voltage is 5.98V.,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11542,49789,i chose 1K and gave me 5.45v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11543,49790,now i have 4.03v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11544,49791,V/R0 to have the current,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11545,49792,then V/A to have the right resistor,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11546,49793,I have RO AS 1000 OHMS,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11547,49794,get your  v goal,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

11563,49810,R0= 560ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11564,49811,mine says get it to 1.99,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11565,49812,mine say 6.24,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11566,49813,i thought we were all supposed to work on the same one and help each other,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11567,49814,i can only get 2.44,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11568,49815,3.95,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

11571,49818,330,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11572,49819,now change back to 270,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11573,49820,i thought that would give us that unknown voltage,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11574,49821,I can't get back to the 5.94V it wants me to have,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11575,49822,5.94,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

11604,49851,2.75,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11605,49852,ok cool. According to the voltage equation the ratio of (R/RT) needs to be 1/4,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11606,49853,2.75=11(R/RT),SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11607,49854,from that ^,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

11826,50073,we have 8 total,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11827,50074,4 resistors in circuit,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11828,50075,Im ready to,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11829,50076,my target voltage is 0.83,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

11831,50078,my target voltage is 3.85,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11832,50079,i got 12.9 Amps,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11833,50080,my circuit reads 0 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11834,50081,thats a big difference,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11835,50082,20 vdc,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11836,50083,14.5 amps,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11837,50084,ok,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11838,50085,if you do it will change the current,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11839,50086,theoretically we should all have the same current,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11840,50087,its saying 0 now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11841,50088,im still at 14.5,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11842,50089,it said 12.1 for a second but then it went away,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11843,50090,wait bear is before lion right,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11844,50091,1. Lion,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11845,50092,I think im circuit one,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11846,50093,2. Bear,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11847,50094,3. Tiger,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11848,50095,We would have to know total current first though,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11849,50096,im at 3.99 volts right now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11850,50097,im at 1.81,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11851,50098,11volts/100 = .11amps for the R0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11852,50099,my voltage is 1.45,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11853,50100,V at r0 = 11 - each of our measured voltage,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11854,50101,so its voltage is .68,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11855,50102,now it is 3.99,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11856,50103,mine is at 3.99 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11857,50104,11-5.64-3.85=1.51,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11858,50105,but theres also the .83,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11859,50106,ok so r0 is 100ohms and my resistance (currently) is 150 ohm,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11860,50107,my resistance is 330,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11861,50108,I think my resistance needs to be 560ohms which puts me at 3.99 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11862,50109,560 + 100 + 330 + 150 = 1140,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11863,50110,1140 total circuit resistance,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11864,50111,now 11/1140 = 0.00965 A,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11865,50112,11-.965=10.035,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11866,50113,my foal voltage is 3.85,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11867,50114,ok so V=RI,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11868,50115,so we can rearrange that to R = V/I,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11869,50116,so the I we are using doesnt work for subsequent calculations,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11870,50117,and then the current ends up being  .0068,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11871,50118,current only changes if the total resistance changes,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11872,50119,V=I*R,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
11873,50120,"to find voltage drop over R0, multiply I*100 ohms",SSI-O,SSI-O,21

12058,50305,so far 14.76 but we also dont know voltage across R0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12059,50306,R0 is 220,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12060,50307,Thats the resistance 220 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12061,50308,the R0 is listed in know info,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12062,50309,Mine is 180,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12063,50310,so my r is 1000,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12064,50311,mine is 270 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12065,50312,1670 ohms total,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12066,50313,I(1670) = 14.76V + I(220ohms),SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12067,50314,the total voltage is equal to the total resistance (1670) times current (I),SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12068,50315,So we solve for I and then take I times Rt (total resistance),SSI-O,SSI-O,21

12081,50328,10.18,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12082,50329,2.75+1.83+10.18= 14.76 V for know voltage drops,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12083,50330,then our total voltage drop would be 14.76 V + voltage drop across R0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12084,50331,Voltage drop across R0 = current (I) x 220 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12085,50332,and it didnt work,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12086,50333,it worked for me,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12087,50334,my goal is 3.18 V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

12183,50430,my circuit voltage just jumped,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12184,50431,680 ohms is too high for me now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12185,50432,mine was at 470 ohms and it was dead on,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12186,50433,Baack at 120 Ohms with a 1.28 V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12187,50434,my target is 1.27,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

12189,50436,me,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12190,50437,R2 (me) should be 950 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12191,50438,and R3 should be 650 ohms or so,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12192,50439,"y, my voltage is 5.43 instead of 4.99 now",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12193,50440,Goal voltage: 2.5,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12194,50441,i need 2.5V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12195,50442,10V and 390ohm,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12196,50443,mine is still 1.65,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12197,50444,oh rigghhhtt...it changes when everybody changes theirs...forgot about that,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12198,50445,the number on the meter,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12199,50446,I've got 7.52 mA here also,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12200,50447,"I can either get 2.29 or 2.6, I can't get 2.5 currently",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12201,50448,its because everybody has to change theres yeag,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12202,50449,im getting 6.94 mA,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12203,50450,mine just says 0.00 for everything right now.,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12204,50451,someone has it disconnected then,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12205,50452,I got 6.94mA now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12206,50453,im still at 00,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12207,50454,i got 9.52 mA,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12208,50455,im good with 7.25 mA,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12209,50456,mine still says 0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12210,50457,It will change when our resistances change,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12211,50458,so we can measure it to be 2.5 volts out,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12212,50459,I'm still measuring 0V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12213,50460,im at 2.39V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12214,50461,mine says 2.39,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

12221,50468,E=16 R0=560 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12222,50469,"E= 16,  R0=560",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12223,50470,16 V supply and 560 ohm resist,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12224,50471,"its 9.52mA rn, but that will change if resistance changes",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12225,50472,closest I can get is 1.19V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12226,50473,I'm at 120 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12227,50474,1.3k not an option on mine,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12228,50475,now I'm up at 6.8V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12229,50476,everybody should have some range ... some range that gets it near your desired voltage....,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12230,50477,Oh i forgot about R0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12231,50478,im ay .99 V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12232,50479,Fulmer showed us how to do this if the Resistances were multiples of each other,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12233,50480,but our desired V  values are not multiples of each other,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12234,50481,i got 4.53,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12235,50482,I got about 150 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

12260,50507,Im R2,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12261,50508,R3 - like I said.,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12262,50509,mine is reading 0V rn,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12263,50510,Im at 1.05V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12264,50511,im at 2.67,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12265,50512,at 0.62,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12266,50513,R2-120 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12267,50514,im at 270 ohm,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

12269,50516,goal is 0.95 V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12270,50517,now my method wont work...lol,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12271,50518,my goal is 3.08,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12272,50519,Goal is 2.61V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12273,50520,I'm at R3,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12274,50521,"i got 12 V, sorry. ill quit",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12275,50522,its a 12 V battery bc i do not h ave any voltage now that youre on 12 V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12276,50523,R2 is 120,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12277,50524,there,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12278,50525,r3 330,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12279,50526,"haha, by ratios of R0 and its voltage drop",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12280,50527,worked last time,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12281,50528,i got 175 hold up,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12282,50529,3.08,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12283,50530,1.27,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12284,50531,need 0.95,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12285,50532,1.27 V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12286,50533,that is V/R to get I,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12287,50534,my goal is 3.75 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12288,50535,my resistance is currently 150,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12289,50536,So we have the current through the circuit 0.0375 A,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12290,50537,i cant measure anything because one of my probes are hiden,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12291,50538,the current is 0.0375 A,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12292,50539,the voltage drop is same t the resistance has to be the same,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12293,50540,"V = I*R, V=3.75 and I = 0.0375",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12294,50541,So all the resistances has to be 100 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12295,50542,5.29 volts for me,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12296,50543,Goal: 7.65,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12297,50544,3.71 Volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12298,50545,So I got current through the circuit of 0.01125 A,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12299,50546,my goal is 4.91,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12300,50547,3.27V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12301,50548,3.93 for me,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12302,50549,i got 0.01353 A,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12303,50550,My goal is 3.75 v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12304,50551,So my target voltage is 3.75V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12305,50552,So that leaves 3.75 volts for R0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12306,50553,Mine is set,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12307,50554,We each control one resistro,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12308,50555,I have r3,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12309,50556,I'm R2,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12310,50557,set,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12311,50558,my goal is 6v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12312,50559,Looks like my target is 3.27V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12313,50560,1.82,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12314,50561,It should be 4.87,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12315,50562,4.87 + 1.86 + 3.76 + 6,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12316,50563,16.49,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12317,50564,it had a weird sextilionth place digit or something,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12318,50565,it's that ugly decimal number,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12319,50566,im at 330ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12320,50567,0.018185,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12321,50568,Thats the current,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12322,50569,100,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12323,50570,im not at my target either,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12324,50571,my goal is 2.02v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12325,50572,1.35,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12326,50573,mine is 9.17,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12327,50574,330 ohlms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12328,50575,mine reads -1.48,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12329,50576,mine is out,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12330,50577,Those connect us to the battery,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12331,50578,so 17v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12332,50579,If you 'view all circuits' it shows us all connected,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12333,50580,Then that leaves 4.46V for R0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12334,50581,So the current is about .013,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12335,50582,0.013515152,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12336,50583,My resistance looks to be about 680 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12337,50584,im at 149.46,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12338,50585,V=IR,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12339,50586,mine are,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12340,50587,so 1.35=0.1351*R,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12341,50588,102.6..,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12342,50589,they should be in,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12343,50590,the resistor is connected on both sides,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12344,50591,Your top two wires look to be disconnected,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12345,50592,Those need to be connected,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12346,50593,that's important,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12347,50594,I have a goal voltage of 2.25V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12348,50595,R2 = 423 ohm,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12349,50596,I have 2.25V now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12350,50597,great alright the target voltage is 6.95V for me,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12351,50598,1.86V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12352,50599,I am at 6.58 right not,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12353,50600,The target voltage is 3.35 V for me.,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12354,50601,target is 2.81V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12355,50602,Mine should be 150 ohms and I'm at 1.45V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12356,50603,correct now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12357,50604,target 4.22V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12358,50605,I think im just 180,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12359,50606,6.09V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12360,50607,He said to give it a little bit more time>,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12361,50608,I can only get it to 2.65 though,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12362,50609,or 2.27,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12363,50610,hey all my goal is to make my voltage 2.5V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12364,50611,1.72,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12365,50612,my goal is 5.31 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12366,50613,6.4,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12367,50614,13.43 total,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12368,50615,.0485 current,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12369,50616,but i only have 33,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12370,50617,this is when im at 120,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12371,50618,im at 270,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12372,50619,im at 150,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12373,50620,im at 120 now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12374,50621,if you divide 16 by 330 it gives .0485,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12375,50622,if i use 0.0086 for the current i get 620 for the resistance,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12376,50623,okay so if .0086 is the current,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12377,50624,16- (1.72+6.4+5.31),SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12378,50625,wait lol i got 0.00778 for the current i,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12379,50626,im at 680,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12380,50627,i got 1.72,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12381,50628,im at 820 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12382,50629,9.48,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12383,50630,i see 0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12384,50631,3.76,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12385,50632,2.09,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12386,50633,4.25,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12387,50634,I think I'm supposed to have current though,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12388,50635,4.25 times 3,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12389,50636,because theres no more current to reach you,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12390,50637,so it was not connected to the voltmeter,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12391,50638,current is meant to be the same for all resistors in series,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12392,50639,it says 4.25 now :),SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12393,50640,thats what out machines say,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12394,50641,4*4.25,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12395,50642,.0354 is the current,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12396,50643,and i got 1.67,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12397,50644,if the total voltage is 17,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12398,50645,and we have 4 resistors with 120 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12399,50646,i got 1.67/120 is 0.01391 for the current,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12400,50647,1.11 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12401,50648,2.62,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12402,50649,7.38,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12403,50650,2.62,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12404,50651,1.62,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12405,50652,im set to 100 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12406,50653,now it 0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12407,50654,and im at 11 volts with that,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12408,50655,i was at 2.62 now at zero,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12409,50656,11 now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12410,50657,im down to 0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12411,50658,im connecte dto the green wires right now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12412,50659,im still at zero,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12413,50660,2.62,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12414,50661,im also still at zero,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12415,50662,okay so is the voltage 11,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12416,50663,im connected to the resistor,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12417,50664,11 was the value when u connected the probes onto the green wire,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12418,50665,im 1t 100,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12419,50666,ok so r0 = 120 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12420,50667,because 11-(2.62+2.62+2.62) = 3.139,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12421,50668,0.09178,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12422,50669,i got 80 ohms for the resistane,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12423,50670,feels way too low tho,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12424,50671,thats 11/120,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12425,50672,im at 18,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12426,50673,Alright i've got 4 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12427,50674,ok so R0 has a voltage drop of 4 as well,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12428,50675,mines at 4.19,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12429,50676,volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12430,50677,alright i'm reading 4,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12431,50678,now ive got 4,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12432,50679,220 for me,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12433,50680,I need 2.03V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12434,50681,I need 2.9 V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12435,50682,i need 3.45,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12436,50683,ok so voltage drop across R0 is about 0.63 then,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12437,50684,well V=IR,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12438,50685,so then V/R=I,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12439,50686,so that leaves 0.62 for v1,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12440,50687,so 0.62/100 = Current,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12441,50688,so 6.2 milliamps,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12442,50689,alright i think i need 327 ohm,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12443,50690,im at 560 about,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12444,50691,i need 4.44,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12445,50692,I need my voltage to be 5.35 V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12446,50693,mine is 2.5,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12447,50694,E is voltage,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12448,50695,E is voltage drop across the entire circuit,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12449,50696,i'm still reading 0 for current,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12450,50697,"oh, pot, your circuit is broken",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12451,50698,and we know the resistance,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12452,50699,so our total resistance is 180,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12453,50700,V/R=I,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12454,50701,0.78/10=I,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12455,50702,okay now i have a reading,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12456,50703,its 77.8 miliamps,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12457,50704,now my reading is gone,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12458,50705,4.44=(0.078)(R),SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12459,50706,So E = IR = (0.078)(180),SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12460,50707,i need 56 ohm,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12461,50708,E = 14.004 V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12462,50709,so resistor 2 is too high,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12463,50710,now im at 2.5,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12464,50711,2.5,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12465,50712,Right now I'm at 150 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12466,50713,5.35 V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12467,50714,"pot: 70 ohm, skillet: 32 ohm",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12468,50715,i need 2.5,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12469,50716,I'm at 68 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12470,50717,"mine's 2.55, but i need 4.44",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12471,50718,ok voltage drop across R0 is 1.71V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12472,50719,okay so e is 14 minus 4.44 minus 2.5 minus 5.35 divided by r0 gives us current,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12473,50720,that value is 0.0114,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12474,50721,ok i'm at 390,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12475,50722,i need 0.69,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12476,50723,I need 4.6 V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12477,50724,3.13,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12478,50725,current for me is 11.58,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12479,50726,resistor at 180,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12480,50727,"The problem is that we don't know R0, so we can't find the total resistance",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12481,50728,(R0+30)(18.97)=V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12482,50729,lol i think it's 11 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12483,50730,thus the voltage is 11v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12484,50731,0.69,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12485,50732,voltage drop of 2.58 over R0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12486,50733,3.13,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12487,50734,4.6,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12488,50735,mine is 0.14,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12489,50736,0.19,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12490,50737,0.14 too,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12491,50738,.01897(r0)=11-(0.19*3),SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12492,50739,i have 0.19,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12493,50740,R0 is 550 ohm,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12494,50741,2.58/550 is the current when ours are at the proper values,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12495,50742,so 11/550,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12496,50743,or 2.58/550,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12497,50744,.0046 amp,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12498,50745,i need 150 ohm,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12499,50746,i need 680,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12500,50747,so 1k,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12501,50748,i said 550,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12502,50749,its your specific voltage drop divided by the current,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12503,50750,11v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12504,50751,I need to enter my unknown values still,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12505,50752,hi i'm hamster and my voltage should be 3.25v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

12507,50754,no it got farther from it,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12508,50755,I was at like 3.1 before,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12509,50756,idk if im reading it wrong w my probes and multimeter but i'm not getting any current at all or voltage on the display,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12510,50757,it says 0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12511,50758,im not getting a reading so im not sure,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12512,50759,it says my current is 11.21 mA,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

12658,50905,she gave me the formula E = I x R0 + I x R1 + I x R2 + I x R3,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12659,50906,im at 100 ohms with 1.14 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12660,50907,i got .0114 for the current,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12661,50908,and when I plugged that in I got E = .0114 x R0 + 11.97,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12662,50909,"idk if any of that makes sense, but that was using the resistances you guys had and plugging in the current I got",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12663,50910,oh i see so for mine at least im just solving for R2,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12664,50911,current,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12665,50912,"Idk if I did that formula right, I got 0.04 as I",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12666,50913,oh actually mines exact now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12667,50914,E is the sum of all of the voltages,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12668,50915,my voltage is 5.88,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12669,50916,Mines at 1.82,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12670,50917,i have to find 1.56V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12671,50919,9.26+ voltage of R0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12672,50920,1.56,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12673,50921,5.88,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12674,50922,1.9,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12675,50923,i got 6.21V for R0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12676,50924,wait my voltage isn't the same anymore,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12677,50925,just need to figure out how,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12678,50926,maybe we do 1.56 = I x R0 and solve for I,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12679,50927,thats really small number tho,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12680,50928,ohm,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12681,50929,i have 1000 ohm too for R0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12682,50930,the 6.21V i got when i changed the resistor to 1000 and read the meter,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12683,50931,thats what we just tried,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12684,50932,oh i guess not because its not R0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12685,50933,mines 180 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12686,50934,680,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12687,50935,mine is 220,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12688,50936,we know the voltage of R1 + R2 + R3,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12689,50937,so for me 1.56V = I x 180ohms then I = 0.00867,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12690,50938,so thats I,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12691,50939,I got 1.9V=Ix220ohm and got .008636,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12692,50940,so V=8.63 for R0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12693,50941,or 8.6,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12694,50942,V=IR and R=1000                                              1000X.0086=8.6 V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12695,50943,so add that to 9.34V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12696,50944,which is 17.94,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12697,50945,so then multiply that times I,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12698,50946,which is 0.154,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12699,50947,oh wait maybe it is 17.94,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12700,50948,E=V0+V1+V2+V3,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12701,50949,it said that in the intro video,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12702,50950,680,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12703,50951,220,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12704,50952,180,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12705,50953,or only once,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12706,50954,it looks like i still can,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12707,50955,how we got our answer,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12708,50956,its 18,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12709,50957,Iowa got 128.7 ohm,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12710,50958,e= 7 volts. goal is 1.75 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12711,50959,red on the left,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12712,50960,it has to be as close to 1.75 as you can,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12713,50961,2.44V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12714,50962,when i put 390 ohm,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12715,50963,i get 1.73,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12716,50964,same,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12717,50965,now it's 1.82,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12718,50966,mine is at 1.67 with 330,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

12739,50987,2.32 at 270ohm,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12740,50988,now it chagned,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12741,50989,i got 2.07 now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12742,50990,270ohm,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12743,50991,my resistor is at 390 ohm,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

12747,50995,now 2,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12748,50996,2.32,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12749,50997,back at 390,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12750,50998,at 330,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12751,50999,"E is unknown, R0 = 560 ƒ??, your goal is to make your voltage 2.38 volts.",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12752,51000,at 2.32,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12753,51001,at 330 ohm. im at 2.83 rn and the target is 3.39,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12754,51002,with 270ohm,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12755,51003,now 2.25,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12756,51004,390 ohm. at 3.25 target is 3.39,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12757,51005,i need to go higher,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12758,51006,i am at 100ohm,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12759,51007,7.2,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12760,51008,is mine,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12761,51009,0.94,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12762,51010,"r0=560 , and goal is 3.39  volts",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12763,51011,"E is unknown, R0 = 560 ƒ??, your goal is to make your voltage 2.38 volts",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12764,51012,idk if it will help but i calculated current,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12765,51013,at 3.36 need to be at 3.39,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12766,51014,and it's .0087A,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12767,51015,2.38 +3.39+ 7.2=,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12768,51016,that what E is,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12769,51017,so i need 273.56321ohm,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12770,51018,13,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12771,51019,V=IR,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12772,51020,so i am at 100ohm and i got 0.87V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12773,51021,"R0 = 560 ƒ??, your goal is to make your voltage 7.2 volts.",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12774,51022,current is all same,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12775,51023,so  I am thinking we can do our calculation,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12776,51024,and come up with each voltage,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12777,51025,and i will calculate voltage for RO,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12778,51026,and we can add em up,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12779,51027,my r is 560,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12780,51028,mine is 271,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12781,51029,271,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12782,51030,my r is 560,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12783,51031,Ro(560ohm)*.0087(I),SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12784,51032,"i have 4,872V for RO",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12785,51033,okay so mine woukd be 560 *0.072,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12786,51034,my goal is 2.38,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12787,51035,and Ro is about 4V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12788,51036,im at 3.47 and my goal is 3.39,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12789,51037,okay so 4.872+2.38+3.39,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12790,51038,without utah i got 10V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12791,51039,she  explianed it as said i ro is 560 riht,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12792,51040,my V is 7.2,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12793,51041,i sum it up and we supposed to have 17.842,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12794,51042,i punched thisnumber in and it says it's wrong haha,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12795,51043,17 it is,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12796,51044,aye i am at 270,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12797,51045,i am at 0.04,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12798,51046,when it says your goal is to make your voltage something,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12799,51047,this is what i got,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12800,51048,2.17v with 270ohm,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12801,51049,voltage/,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12802,51050,aye everyone has their values,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12803,51051,my goal is set for 3.75V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12804,51052,I have 120 Ohms of resistance,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12805,51053,my goals is 2.53V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12806,51054,my goal is 0.78V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12807,51055,mine is 3.05,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12808,51056,Okay currently with 270 Ohms i am reading 2.62,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12809,51057,now its 2.81,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12810,51058,i have a reading of 0.78 at 120 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12811,51059,my value is showing,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12812,51060,my goal is 9.56,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12813,51061,my goal is 4.55V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12814,51062,my goal is 1.75V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12815,51063,mine was 820 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12816,51064,mine is 150 Ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12817,51065,Don't forget the R0 value too!,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12818,51066,E can also be equal to IxR0 + IxR1...,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12819,51067,i have no clue it didnt say,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12820,51068,"that was just for our resistor values, nevermind",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12821,51069,"I think the reason why E is wrong is  because we didn't add the voltage for R0, that's why it can't be 15.86V",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12822,51070,820 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12823,51071,okay when changing my resistor to the 270 Ohms they use in the internal resistor (R0) I read 2.93V. Everything added up I got a total of 18.79V across all resistors and 1630 Ohms across all resistors. But that is before calculating current with I=V/R,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12824,51072,I got a current of 11.53 by using I=V/R where V= 18.79v and R= 1.63 Micro Ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12825,51073,I have a current reading of 15.32mA,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12826,51074,i have a reading of 23.5mA,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12827,51075,i got 0.012A or 1.12mA,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12828,51076,0.01165 or 1.17,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12829,51077,when i divided my voltage (1.75v) by my resistance (150 Ohms) i got 0.011666,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12830,51078,or 1.17mA,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12831,51079,19 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12832,51080,I got 19.0709. So 19,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12833,51081,My goal is 4.5,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12834,51082,I've got 4.5 on my multimeter,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12835,51083,I think E=I x R,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12836,51084,that thye gave me,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12837,51085,"Okay I'm struggling to even figure out where to put my numbers, my numbers are E=18 and r0=150",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12838,51086,my goal is 2.88 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12839,51087,Ive got 6.12,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12840,51088,My goal is .61 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12841,51089,Mine says .61 right now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12842,51090,Never mind it just changed,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12843,51091,E= I x R,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12844,51092,"Me either, I have E=12v, Ro= 390 and goal of 6.12V",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12845,51093,I have those same numbers by .61 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12846,51094,Mine reads .59 right now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12847,51095,I'm at 2.78 but need 2.88,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12848,51096,Mine dropped,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12849,51097,okay im at 2.90,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12850,51098,If i put mine up another resistor I am over,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12851,51099,Im at .51 now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12852,51100,Mine is jumping from .59 to .61,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12853,51101,I'm at 2.78 at 390 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12854,51102,Im at .59 at 82 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12855,51103,I am at 5.85 at 820 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12856,51104,Now 6.07,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12857,51105,back down to 5.85,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12858,51106,formula,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12859,51107,obviously e is 12,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12860,51108,Banu just told me the formula we need is E=IR+(IxR1)+(IxR2) +(IxR3),SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12861,51109,where the values of R1 R2 and R3 would be our three different resistors,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12862,51110,I think I is .0307,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12863,51111,I believe it is 12/390 assuming E=IR,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12864,51112,I really think the resistor I need to use is either 82 or 68 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12865,51113,R0 is defenitely 390,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12866,51114,I'm at 2.78 at 390,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12867,51115,100 brings me to .71,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12868,51116,I need 0.76,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12869,51117,my goal is voltage to 2.37,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12870,51118,i need 1.4,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12871,51119,I'm at 2.33 at 560,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12872,51120,1.62 with a 390 ohm resistor,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12873,51121,okay im at 2.41,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12874,51122,Im at 1.42 now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12875,51123,Probably with the formula I have cuz I have the whole right side now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12876,51124,560,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12877,51125,180 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12878,51126,330,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12879,51127,that banu told you,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12880,51128,I feel like I solved it but it wont work,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12881,51129,E=IxR0+V1+V2+V3,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12882,51130,I should be .00424 if im not mistaken,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12883,51131,for me it would be 1.4/330,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12884,51132,for you guys it would be whatever your voltage is divided by resistor,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12885,51133,So like the resistor I had was 330 when we completed it,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12886,51134,All of our voltage values,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12887,51135,so 1.4 .76 2.73,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12888,51136,mine is 2.37,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12889,51137,and its volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12890,51138,So E= your 2.37 / your resistance then that value you just solved for x 1890,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12891,51139,Mine is 8 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12892,51140,It didn,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12893,51141,didnt like that I put in the exact value,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12894,51142,My exact value was 8.36 and it said that was wrong until I plugged in 8,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12895,51143,Yeah mine was 7.99 and i rounded to 8,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12896,51144,well we have all the numbers for this one,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12897,51145,ight my goal is 4volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12898,51146,my is 4 V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12899,51147,im ready whenever,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12900,51148,ready,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12901,51149,okay so my volt needs to be 0.63,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12902,51150,mine needs to be 2.95,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12903,51151,mine is 0.95 V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12904,51152,like mines decreasing when i have it at a set value,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12905,51153,470,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12906,51154,470,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12907,51155,1.75 v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12908,51156,im at .67 v at 150 resistance,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12909,51157,im at 2.65,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12910,51158,at 180 ohms it lowers mine to 1 V but i need it to be at .95 V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12911,51159,0.63,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12912,51160,0.95,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12913,51161,what i need,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12914,51162,my goal is 2.22,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12915,51163,4.66,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12916,51164,my goal is 1.25,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12917,51165,im at 4.62 volts atm,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12918,51166,need 4.66,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12919,51167,i dont have a better idea hahaha,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12920,51168,the resistances are added up R1 + R2 +R3,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12921,51169,thats what i was thinking at sea,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12922,51170,is it different for everyone. mine is 330 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12923,51171,im at 1.3V right now and i need to get to 1.25 so...,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12924,51172,2.15,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12925,51173,i need 2.22,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12926,51174,well im second,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12927,51175,down in resistance to increase voltage,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12928,51176,so im at 4.83 v i need to be at 4.66,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12929,51177,so the first person is the voltage after its been decreased by the r0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12930,51178,470,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12931,51179,i have mine set to 270,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12932,51180,so what i was thinking,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12933,51181,we each indivdually have our own R0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12934,51182,so in the circuit below,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12935,51183,we have R0 in series with R1 R2 R3,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12936,51184,330,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12937,51185,330,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12938,51186,we all have the same,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12939,51187,we each have our own resistance,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12940,51188,4.66,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12941,51189,my resistance is 390,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12942,51190,820,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12943,51191,220,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12944,51192,dont forget 330,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12945,51193,I have R2. My goal is 4V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12946,51194,"I have R0, my goal voltage is 4V",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12947,51195,*R1,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12948,51196,DCV 20,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12949,51197,"Okay, I have R1",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12950,51198,"Then R2, then R3 has the smaller resistance",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12951,51199,I have R3,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12952,51200,it reads 0.00,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12953,51201,Mine is reading 4,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12954,51202,Now it reads 4,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12955,51203,now it says 4,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12956,51204,I have R1 again with a goal voltage of 5.82.,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12957,51205,I have R3 and my goal is 1.28V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12958,51206,Peach R2 with a goal of 3.34 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12959,51207,Okay my voltmeter reads that im at 2.41V right now. With a resistance of 330,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12960,51208,mine reads 7.31,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12961,51209,"So every time you increase your resistance, you increase the current",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12962,51210,At 0.03V now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12963,51211,Im at a resistance of 560 right now and im reading 3.29V. i need to get it to 5.82V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12964,51212,"Well, once R1 is done adjusting, R2 will adjust and mess it up",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12965,51213,Because the total current is dependent on the total resistance,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12966,51214,So let's say the total resistance in is 2000 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12967,51215,Then the current would be 0.0095,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12968,51216,With R1 having the higher resistance and R2 following then R3,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12969,51217,The reason why all 3 of us need to add up to 1000 ohms is because R0 is 1000 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12970,51218,it reads 3.03,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12971,51219,Only lets me set to 470 or 560,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12972,51220,R2,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12973,51221,i'm at 330,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12974,51222,R2 330 and the meter reads 3.03,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12975,51223,R1 at 470 reading 4.31,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12976,51224,goal is 5.82,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12977,51225,"At 680 and reading 5.67, almost at 5.82",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12978,51226,330 Ohms and 2.68 DCV 20,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12979,51227,3.34 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12980,51228,just me and peach already exceed the overall resistance,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12981,51229,5.38V with a resistance of 680,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12982,51230,"R1, goal is 3.6V",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12983,51231,Im not,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12984,51232,R2 390Ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12985,51233,goal is 7.47,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12986,51234,I'm R2,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12987,51235,im R3,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12988,51236,Ok. So that means that R3 needs a small resistance,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12989,51237,3.08,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12990,51238,R2 = 3.08,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12991,51239,R1=3.08,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12992,51240,R3 = 3.08,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12993,51241,"Im at 3.08V, need to get to 3.6V",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12994,51242,R3 at 390 ohms 7.7 on the meter and my goal is 7.47,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12995,51243,its 7.04 now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12996,51244,that made it lower,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12997,51245,maybe I should increase mine,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12998,51246,i was at 390,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
12999,51247,"Im at 3V, need to be at 3.6",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13000,51248,220 is the R0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13001,51249,150 and 3V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13002,51250,My goal is 3.6V lol,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13003,51251,Now im at 3.55V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13004,51252,330 Ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13005,51253,6.5 on meter,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13006,51254,7.47 is my goal,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13007,51255,7.01,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13008,51256,my goal is 4.75,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13009,51257,that gets me 5.91 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13010,51258,It has to be 470 ohms. We each have to have the same voltage drop and that means we multiply 4.75 by 3 and subtract the total (19) to get 4.75 V for the 470 ohm resistor meaning ours has to be 470 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13011,51259,my goal is 3.33 v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13012,51260,mines 2.81,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13013,51261,4.01,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13014,51262,330 for Baked,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13015,51263,470 for Fries,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13016,51264,470,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13017,51265,goal is 4.65,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13018,51266,my goal is 1.95,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13019,51267,2.12,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13020,51268,im at 1.68 i need 1.69,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13021,51269,I get up to 4.77 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13022,51270,180,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13023,51271,Mine is 180,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13024,51272,390,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13025,51273,2.13 just then,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13026,51274,im at 1.69,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13027,51275,I'm at .66,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13028,51276,and the only way to find that out is using the current. and we can find the current once the resistors match as we will have the total resistance along with the current.,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13029,51277,150 Ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13030,51278,120 Ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13031,51279,im at 330,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13032,51280,was 680*.01667,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13033,51281,i dont have a calculator,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13034,51282,13.026,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13035,51283,It wrong,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13036,51284,its 11.024 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13037,51285,the current is .01413,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13038,51286,so it's 780 * .o1413,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13039,51287,my current is .01607,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13040,51288,i got .01413 as well,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13041,51289,Its to the nearest whole number it was 11 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13042,51290,goal is 3.25,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13043,51291,im at 4.41,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

13200,51448,4.67,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13201,51449,ok so our total R is 220,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13202,51450,that puts us at 330ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13203,51451,so the current is going to be .0818,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13204,51452,if its 18v and the total r is 220 and we divide the v/r,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13205,51453,ryan said he would figure it out,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13206,51454,hes checking his notes,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13207,51455,i think im at 4.7 v rn,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13208,51456,4.5,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13209,51457,mine is 4.5v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13210,51458,mine says 4.66 rn,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13211,51459,0.08,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13212,51460,we have the current and the voltage he wants us at,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13213,51461,p=.36,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13214,51462,ok so we have the total v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13215,51463,and we all have our personal v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13216,51464,so 4.5x3 is 13.5,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

13227,51475,at 820,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13228,51476,or something,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13229,51477,5.59,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13230,51478,im trting to figure it out,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13231,51479,7.83,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13232,51480,im supposed to be at 1.72,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13233,51481,3.06,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13234,51482,1.9 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13235,51483,im at 220,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13236,51484,6.92,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13237,51485,1.83,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13238,51486,1.02,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13239,51487,blue is 1.02,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13240,51488,so my resistance is at 390 right now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13241,51489,im r1,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13242,51490,i need 4.5 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13243,51491,i need 4.5 too,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13244,51492,11.25 for current,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13245,51493,so at the top its giving me 18 voltsa,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13246,51494,i thought current should be the same throughout the whole circuit,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13247,51495,maybe something with power,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13248,51496,sorry my goal is 4.5v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13249,51497,ok so my resistor is 820 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13250,51498,total of all resisitors is 2460,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13251,51499,because theres only 3,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13252,51500,i got 5.48,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13253,51501,mili amps,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13254,51502,5.48,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13255,51503,so when i try to find resistance by doing R3=Vr3/IT i get around 820,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13256,51504,since we all have the same voltage goal,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13257,51505,the closest i got was to 4.95,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13258,51506,with a 1k r,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13259,51507,were at 4.7,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13260,51508,i am',SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13261,51509,it dropped,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13262,51510,4.05,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13263,51511,3.84,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13264,51512,mines at 369,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13265,51513,469,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13266,51514,4.48 right there,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13267,51515,im at 4.48,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13268,51516,theres a tolerance,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13269,51517,so i was at 1k,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13270,51518,when it was 4.48,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13271,51519,im at 4.7 now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13272,51520,4.71,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13273,51521,so r0 volts is 4.5 too,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13274,51522,its gotta be 820,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13275,51523,i need .43 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13276,51524,my goal is 1.16 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13277,51525,i need 2.91,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13278,51526,my voltage reading is at 2.43,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13279,51527,i need 4.59 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13280,51528,i need 1.03,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13281,51529,i need 1.55,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13282,51530,im at 1.56,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13283,51531,im at 5.76,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13284,51532,im at 2.2,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13285,51533,ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13286,51534,ok im at 1k,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13287,51535,im at 1k. its reading 4.62,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13288,51536,4.62,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13289,51537,total voltage is 17 then,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13290,51538,1.03 here,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13291,51539,8.59,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13292,51540,im at 5.59,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13293,51541,so the voltage of r0 is 5.83,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13294,51542,5.83/820,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13295,51543,i got 7mili amps,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13296,51544,4.47 is what i got,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13297,51545,100 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13298,51546,i think i need to be at 180,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13299,51547,ok im at 1.5,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13300,51548,resisitor,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13301,51549,180,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13302,51550,im at 1.5,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13303,51551,to 1.2,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13304,51552,150 now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13305,51553,4.21V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13306,51554,.51 v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13307,51555,0.42,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13308,51556,i got 8,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13309,51557,so our vin would be 8 voltys,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13310,51558,we dont have a resistance for r0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13311,51559,R0 VOLTAGE IS GONNA BE 2.86V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13312,51560,its saying its wrong,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13313,51561,but the volts is correct,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13314,51562,E,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13315,51563,4.57 mili amps,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13316,51564,im not getting any reading,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13317,51565,1.6k ohms for total resistor,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13318,51566,4.91 is current,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13319,51567,2.86/4.91,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13320,51568,thats r0 resistance,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13321,51569,got 1.9 v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13322,51570,i have 1.9,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13323,51571,im at 2.09,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13324,51572,im still at 150,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13325,51573,it changed to 2.11,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13326,51574,i got 1.68,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13327,51575,its 150,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13328,51576,ok im at 2v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13329,51577,im at 1.6,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13330,51578,at 150 i got 1.9 v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13331,51579,it said 2 now says 1.9,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13332,51580,680,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13333,51581,im on 680 and now at 11.97,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13334,51582,0.01,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13335,51583,at 680,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

13344,51592,thats just for Ro,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13345,51593,so 2 need 1 volt and one needs 1.25,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13346,51594,"current is the same throughout the whole circuit, im just not sure if it needs to be the voltage drop of R0 or total voltage",SSI-O,SSI-O,21

13355,51603,im at 3.50 now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13356,51604,total should only be 470,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

13614,51862,im measuring 6.38 mv,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13615,51863,I have 8.1,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13616,51864,series amps,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13617,51865,It wants to be 1k,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13618,51866,It wants to still be 1.26 mA,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13619,51867,mine changed...,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13620,51868,still getting 6.38,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13621,51869,now I'm back at 8.65,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13622,51870,"wait a second, it just jumped",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13623,51871,i went to like 9 now im back to 6.3,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13624,51872,It's all consistent because of the series,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13625,51873,"So we are using the same current, I guess.",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13626,51874,I have 6,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13627,51875,6mA,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13628,51876,24 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13629,51877,=,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13630,51878,I'm getting ~378,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13631,51879,closest option is 390,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13632,51880,which is somethign we came up with,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13633,51881,the R0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13634,51882,I think forcing the current didnt exactly get us anywhere,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13635,51883,R0 needs to use 18.58 V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13636,51884,.01858 amps,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13637,51885,my result would be ~122 ohms or 120 ohm is the closest,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13638,51886,I get 101.7,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13639,51887,120 ohm,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13640,51888,I'm on 100,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13641,51889,im reading .97 volts so far,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13642,51890,I'm only reading 1.68,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13643,51891,I'm at 1.4,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13644,51892,I'm reading 1.0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13645,51893,"ok the order of series is pliers, then me, then wrench",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13646,51894,the sum of what we just put,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13647,51895,the sum of our volt goals,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13648,51896,we need the right amps to use,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13649,51897,It'd be around 5 amd a half.,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13650,51898,"we know our total V, just like the first ones",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13651,51899,it says 24v is incorrect,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13652,51900,24 isnt right,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13653,51901,thye current changes as the load changes,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13654,51902,"we know the sum of the voltage across our aggregate, i.e. what our resultant divided voltage should be",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13655,51903,"Alright, so now we know V",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13656,51904,"ok, so 18-5.42",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13657,51905,13.42,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13658,51906,so 12.58 used by R0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13659,51907,I get 12.58 mA,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13660,51908,180 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13661,51909,so 150 ohm for me,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13662,51910,I'm at 1.93 now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13663,51911,2.27 on the mooney,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13664,51912,They're both down,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13665,51913,i need 1.22 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13666,51914,Ineed 4.79,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13667,51915,I need 2.75 Volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13668,51916,8.76 total,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13669,51917,2.12 V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13670,51918,26.2 mA,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13671,51919,so we have 6.36 V of 8.76,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13672,51920,right now we total 6.36,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13673,51921,mine is at 1.59 now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13674,51922,okay between 270 ohm and 330 ohm,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13675,51923,bc ours change too,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13676,51924,"i read 4.3, which means we're at 8.52 i think",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13677,51925,total voltage drop,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13678,51926,"well, ours will be the same at 100ohm",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13679,51927,It's 1.59,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13680,51928,4.18,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13681,51929,1.86,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13682,51930,1.55,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13683,51931,7.59 total,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13684,51932,circuit 3,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13685,51933,circuit 2,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13686,51934,got 2 here,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13687,51935,"12 volts, r0 220, goal voltage is 3",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13688,51936,my resistance is down to180 now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13689,51937,mine is 120,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13690,51938,mine says r0 should be 220,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13691,51939,"we don't have control of r0, thats fixed",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13692,51940,alright my resistance  is 180 now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13693,51941,"so we have a 180,180, and a 120",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13694,51942,at 120,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13695,51943,so 120 120 and 180,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13696,51944,cause we are at 2.25,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13697,51945,my voltmeter says 3.37 rn,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13698,51946,"mine is 2.36, needs to be 3 at circuit 2",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13699,51947,150,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13700,51948,3,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13701,51949,so resistance. i have 120,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13702,51950,maynard you have 150,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13703,51951,120,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13704,51952,ok so our equilavent reistance is 220+240+150,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13705,51953,19.6 mA,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13706,51954,that's what we  need to be 3,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13707,51955,my voltage is 2.95 at the moment,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13708,51956,mine is 2.36,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13709,51957,mine is 2.36 as well,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13710,51958,3.38,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13711,51959,ok right now our eq. reisstance is 880,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13712,51960,circuit 1,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13713,51961,circuit 3 needs 4.88 V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13714,51962,my resistance is 180,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13715,51963,circuit 1 needs to be 7.06,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13716,51964,so in my case I need 2.81 V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13717,51965,i need 7.06 and  i am currently at 7.23,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13718,51966,circuit 1 needs voltage to be 7.06,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13719,51967,7.06,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13720,51968,ok so the voltage drop from resistor 0 is,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13721,51969,2.46,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13722,51970,and I need 2.81,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13723,51971,"so, 12 - I(120) - 7.06 - 2.81 = 0",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13724,51972,so starting with resistor 1. we have a voltage of 13.54 to work with,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13725,51973,"whoops, forgot mine, -4.88",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13726,51974,7.06,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13727,51975,ok so using 14.54 as our starting voltagre,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13728,51976,you need almost half of that,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13729,51977,which means the sum or 2 and 3 equals youres,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13730,51978,390,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13731,51979,so 7.06/390,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13732,51980,i get a current of 18.1,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13733,51981,0.018102564,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13734,51982,I got I = 0.0104,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13735,51983,maynard your resistance is 7.06/your current,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13736,51984,so that would be 392,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13737,51985,my resistor is currently 390,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13738,51986,"we all have the same current, should be 0.0104",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13739,51987,now i got 678.846,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13740,51988,so after your voltagre drop,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13741,51989,so there is 6.5 volts left,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13742,51990,and I need 2.81 of that,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13743,51991,using the current of .01,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13744,51992,i get a reistor or 270,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13745,51993,circuit 3: goal voltage is 5.06,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13746,51994,3.5,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13747,51995,circuit 1 voltage 7.44,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13748,51996,mine currently reads 10.47,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13749,51997,E - I(270) -7.44 - 3.5 - 5.06 = 0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13750,51998,im at 270,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13751,51999,cool 4.5 x 4 = 18,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13752,52000,e = 18,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13753,52001,im getting a reading,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13754,52002,circuit 1 7.44,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13755,52003,3.5,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13756,52004,5.06,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13757,52005,3.5 for circuit 2,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13758,52006,I = 0.0074 A,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13759,52007,472,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13760,52008,683..78,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13761,52009,so I have one now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13762,52010,circuit 3: goal voltage is 3.91 v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13763,52011,and my voltage is .59,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13764,52012,circuit 2 voltage 2.66v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13765,52013,i have 2.54,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13766,52014,jk i have 10.71,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13767,52015,my current voltage is .90,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13768,52016,100 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13769,52017,1.17,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13770,52018,1.17 now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13771,52019,so the equation is,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13772,52020,im getting three,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13773,52021,8.2M ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13774,52022,2.99,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13775,52023,so the E is atleast 9,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13776,52024,my voltage is now 3.91,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13777,52025,I need 4 as well,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13778,52026,so we can work collaboratively and help eachother,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13779,52027,it's only giving me certain values,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13780,52028,ohhh I found it,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13781,52029,that went so bad so fast,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13782,52030,my goal is 3.51,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13783,52031,mine is .09,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13784,52032,4.23,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13785,52033,me,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13786,52034,we know its 150 tho,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13787,52035,but we know its 150,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13788,52036,omg we can just measure I with the meter,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13789,52037,thats what I was saying,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13790,52038,"oh okay, i thought each one just affected the ones after it, my bad",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13791,52039,so I need to be .423 of the Resistance,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13792,52040,our nubmers changed :'(,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13793,52041,I have .9 Volts now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13794,52042,I have 2.35,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13795,52043,I have the last resistor R3 at 180 ohm,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13796,52044,I'm at 470,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13797,52045,and edit resistor and a drop down thing will pop up,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13798,52046,mine is 180,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13799,52047,the thing in the middle of the board,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13800,52048,its striped,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13801,52049,It's at 150,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13802,52050,"so we have 150, 180 and 470",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13803,52051,remember Ro is 1000,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13804,52052,there's no 450,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13805,52053,all i got from the video was e = ir,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13806,52054,E(voltage)=I(current)*R(resistance),SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13807,52055,E=IR,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13808,52056,it's a ratio at this point,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13809,52057,9/4 = 2.25,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13810,52058,im at 1000,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13811,52059,9,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13812,52060,my goal is 2.86 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13813,52061,i gotta get 3.47,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13814,52062,i need 1.99 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13815,52063,that means Ro needs 2.29,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13816,52064,i am at 3.82,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13817,52065,i am 1.79,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13818,52066,with 470 horseshoes,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13819,52067,i hvae 100 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13820,52068,1000,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13821,52069,1.78,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13822,52070,now im at 4.57,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13823,52071,2.15,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13824,52072,i am at 1.74 i need 1.99,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13825,52073,"im at 3.61, need 3.47",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13826,52074,i'm still 0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13827,52075,my red lead was slightly off,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13828,52076,i'm at 470,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13829,52077,3.15,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13830,52078,1.85,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13831,52079,we don't,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13832,52080,my goal is 4.5,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13833,52081,mine's at 14.91 now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13834,52082,okay mine is 2.03,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13835,52083,now mine is 8.26,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13836,52084,V=IR,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13837,52085,okay i have 3.99,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13838,52086,but circut 2 go before 3,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13839,52087,4 on the little device in the corner,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13840,52088,on the multimeter,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13841,52089,but under amp its 06.7,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13842,52090,okay mine says -2.29,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13843,52091,now -3.30,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13844,52092,cause the - just means the probes are switched sides,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13845,52093,oh mine went up,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13846,52094,I'm at 2.67,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13847,52095,im at 3.83,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13848,52096,i'm at 4.65 dcv 20 with a 680 resistance,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13849,52097,wait I got it,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13850,52098,I can get 4.64 with 820 on resistor,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

13926,52174,my multimeter is not showing any values even when it's connected...,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13927,52175,we have to connect the green wires,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13928,52176,to the breadboard,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13929,52177,"Okay, so if you move the red lead to the left wire it shows v",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13930,52178,20 i think,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13931,52179,im between 15 and 18 ohms right now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13932,52180,im at 150,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13933,52181,ok now im at 100,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

13936,52184,im at 39 ohm,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13937,52185,im at 100 still but i need to be much higher in voltage,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13938,52186,I'm at 68 ohm,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13939,52187,im like at 7 and i need 7.25,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

13946,52194,I'm at 180ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13947,52195,well we're not allowed to write anything so the formula is useless,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13948,52196,hey so im at 560,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13949,52197,im at 150,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13950,52198,I'm at 220,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13951,52199,i need 1.95V i'm at 1.89V now with 150 ohm,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13952,52200,I need 2.92volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13953,52201,"so its about 3+2+7, which is almost 13...",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13954,52202,the third person is bear,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13955,52203,you have to keep the green ones plugged in,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13956,52204,i am reading 2.29,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13957,52205,i got 2.75,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13958,52206,three,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13959,52207,it waiting on the third person,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13960,52208,bear you nplugged,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13961,52209,bear the resistor too,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13962,52210,he put it in,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13963,52211,1k,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13964,52212,the voltage will be like 3-3.48,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13965,52213,some one changed that,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13966,52214,680 and 560 isn't going through,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13967,52215,"Alright, mine is at 560",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13968,52216,i got around 3.4-3.5,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13969,52217,but its changing now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13970,52218,im getting 3.13,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13971,52219,got 3.32,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13972,52220,because its changing,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13973,52221,Me too. 3.32,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13974,52222,it needs higher value now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

13983,52231,39K,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13984,52232,its on 20,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13985,52233,thats cause you are connecting the wires wrong,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13986,52234,I GOT 5.47,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13987,52235,ITS 33K OHM,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13988,52236,i got 3.65,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13989,52237,29k says -4.45,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13990,52238,33k says 0.01,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13991,52239,my goal is 2.75,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13992,52240,Mine is also 2.5,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13993,52241,my goal is 2.75,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13994,52242,the resister,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13995,52243,"I think we put them on either side of the resistor, but not 100% sure",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13996,52244,20 DCV,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13997,52245,mine is 2.03 currently,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13998,52246,im at 5.21 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
13999,52247,i have resister 2,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14000,52248,Total voltage is 11,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14001,52249,The current changes depending on the resistance we have it at,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14002,52250,in on 10,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14003,52251,0.26,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14004,52252,Mine says 0.26,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14005,52253,0.26,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14006,52254,"Okay, so we have a total resistance of 320 I think",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14007,52255,And a total voltage of 11,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14008,52256,oooh so theres a 4th resister,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14009,52257,R0 is 390,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14010,52258,It's the same for all of us,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14011,52259,ok and we are all at 10 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14012,52260,1.6,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14013,52261,1.42,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

14020,52268,2.47,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14021,52269,Mine says 2.47 too,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14022,52270,330,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14023,52271,2.63,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14024,52272,2.63,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14025,52273,V=IR,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14026,52274,Which means our current and resistance will be proportionate,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14027,52275,And all our current should be the same,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14028,52276,mines 2.75,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14029,52277,Mine is also 2.75,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14030,52278,2.75,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14031,52279,2.75,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14032,52280,goal 8.03,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14033,52281,Mine's 1.2,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14034,52282,my goal is 0.8,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14035,52283,my goal is 0.8 and at 120 ohms I'm at 0.7,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14036,52284,So it's gotta be coordinated,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14037,52285,at 120 mine is 2.75,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14038,52286,"so R1 needs 0.8 V, R2 needs 8.03 V, and R3 needs 1.2 V",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14039,52287,We also know all the voltages have to add up to 11,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14040,52288,0.8+.8.03+1.2,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14041,52289,So R0 has a voltage of .97,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14042,52290,The current is gonna be like .00808333333 apparently,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14043,52291,"Mine was like 148.45, which I can round to 150 I guess",SSI-O,SSI-O,21

14556,52806,mine is currently at 330,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14557,52807,330 is the resistor that is perminately in the system,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14558,52808,the 330 at the top is the resistor in the circuit perminately,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14559,52809,like rn i have a 330 in there but my voltage is 3.4 V but when i go down one resistor value its too low voltage,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

14681,52931,i havent had 1.92 yet,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14682,52932,something to do with Ohm's law,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14683,52933,E= I*R,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14684,52934,Voltage = current times resistance,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

14940,53192,Mine right now is 2.02,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14941,53193,mine reads 7.53,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14942,53194,So now I'm at 1.16,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14943,53195,OK. I am V1 = 5.4,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14944,53196,ive got 7.91,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14945,53197,So V0 = 4.53,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14946,53198,My resistor is at 120 Ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14947,53199,E=19volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14948,53200,all I know is E=I*R,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14949,53201,and E=sumV,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14950,53202,all of our voltages added up need to equal 19,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14951,53203,and its a series,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14952,53204,120 Ohms 2.07 V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14953,53205,Goal: 4.75V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14954,53206,im at 270ohms now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14955,53207,my mulimeter reads 4.10 now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14956,53208,If i put it on 330ohms my thing reads 4.79,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14957,53209,mine just read 4.75,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

14963,53215,im at 330ohms and it reads 4.29,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14964,53216,now im at 4.12,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14965,53217,if i do 270 it reads 3.51,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14966,53218,I think our ohms have to go up,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14967,53219,its some sort of pattern or ratio,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14968,53220,everyone has to be on the same resistance,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14969,53221,4.75,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14970,53222,4.75 is the goal,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

14982,53234,7.31,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14983,53235,oh shoot. mine is .88,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14984,53236,wait im R1 and i cant edit,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14985,53237,my goal is 4.97,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14986,53238,R0=390ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

14998,53250,im at 3.34,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
14999,53251,okay so I'm R3 and my goal is 4 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15000,53252,My goal is also 4 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15001,53253,Mine is also 4,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15002,53254,mine is 2.82,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15003,53255,-.16 lol,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15004,53256,Mine is  2.35,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15005,53257,Wait mine just went to zero,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15006,53258,Now it just says zero,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15007,53259,all i can do with the green wire is take it out,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15008,53260,and put it back in,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15009,53261,The resistance for all the different colors is the same,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15010,53262,680,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15011,53263,0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15012,53264,Mine is zero too,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15013,53265,From the meter,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15014,53266,0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15015,53267,my stuff is all plugged in,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15016,53268,Wait 170 isnt an option,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15017,53269,"I don't have a 170 either, lol",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15018,53270,Mine says 2.36,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15019,53271,and the meter said 2.36,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15020,53272,But resistance times current gives you vtage,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15021,53273,"okay so E=IR, E=16, R0=680, so I=42.5",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15022,53274,so the current is the same for all resistors,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15023,53275,On the absolute highest resistance the current gives u 16,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15024,53276,so 8.2kOhms divided by 4 is 2.05,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15025,53277,mine still says zero,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15026,53278,DCV 20,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15027,53279,14.44,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15028,53280,0.26,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15029,53281,so that it's in volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15030,53282,So then we only have resistance to wor wiht,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15031,53283,8.3,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15032,53284,If you put it on 4.7Kohms its 3.9,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15033,53285,I wanna see how it changes our numbers,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15034,53286,Mine is 5.21,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15035,53287,Mine is 6.28,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15036,53288,R=2.7 kohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

15039,53291,6.25,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15040,53292,we are measuring in dvc I think because we want voltage,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15041,53293,3.3kOhm or 3.3Mohm,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15042,53294,mines on 3.3kohms and reading is 4.99 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15043,53295,MINE IS 4.99 too!!,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15044,53296,mine says 4.99 oo,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15045,53297,reading is 4.92,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15046,53298,im on that,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15047,53299,4.92,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

15078,53330,180,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15079,53331,same but thats not getting me 4.5,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15080,53332,it said 4.5 a minute ago but no its 3.3,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15081,53333,330 works for me now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15082,53334,now mine says 6.9,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15083,53335,mine is 6.7 lol,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

15096,53348,my goal is 1.48,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15097,53349,im 1.77,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15098,53350,6.69,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15099,53351,all our voltages are gonna be equal i think,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15100,53352,total resistance has to be 205 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15101,53353,"47, 68, and 100",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15102,53354,"10, 15, and 180",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15103,53355,i got 15,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15104,53356,it didnt change,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15105,53357,my measuring thing says 1.23 volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15106,53358,mine says .07,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

15108,53360,it doesnt change in series circuit,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15109,53361,7/820,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15110,53362,ik the voltage in R0 is 1.75 too,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15111,53363,cuz E is jus our 4 voltages added up,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15112,53364,mine just says 0.00 now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15113,53365,hawk,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15114,53366,im circuit 3 but mine are hooked up. i got red probe on the left part of the resistor and black probe on the right part of the resistor,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15115,53367,so your voltage needs to read at 1.75,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15116,53368,mine says 1.12 rn,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15117,53369,1.03,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15118,53370,1.16,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15119,53371,mines low,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15120,53372,4*(1.75) = 7,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15121,53373,mine's saying 1.26,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15122,53374,mine says 1.81 im at 560ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15123,53375,i put mine to 390ohms and im at 1.41V now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15124,53376,mines at 470 and 1.73,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15125,53377,now 1.77,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15126,53378,mines at 560 and 1.69,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15127,53379,im at 470ohms and 1.30V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15128,53380,560 ohms and 1.55,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15129,53381,now im 560ohms 1.50V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15130,53382,well mine says 0 now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15131,53383,nvm we good,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15132,53384,good now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15133,53385,were good,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15134,53386,im at 560ohms 1.57V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15135,53387,im at 1.5V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15136,53388,560ohms says 1.57 for me and 680 says 1.82,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15137,53389,mine says the same as seagull for 560ohms and 680 ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15138,53390,470 has me at 1.77 now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15139,53391,1.79 now,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15140,53392,im 470ohms and 1.79V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15141,53393,1.77,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15142,53394,1.77V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

15144,53396,20,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15145,53397,"So mine says 0.00, idk if we all need to  connect or something",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15146,53398,as well as R0,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15147,53399,im getting like 22.6,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15148,53400,"So i have r1, and its resistance is 69",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15149,53401,63 now nvm,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15150,53402,"Ok, so mine is 13.1, while my resistor is at 5.6M olhms",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15151,53403,bc its the same current and same voltage drop across each one,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15152,53404,V=IR and all that,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15153,53405,so each one of our resistors will add up with the others to equal the R in V = IR,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15154,53406,its like 0.03 amps,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15155,53407,red: i think R0 is a given resistance in the series we have to solve,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15156,53408,I have r1 and you two have r2 and r3,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15157,53409,R=R0+R1+R2+R3 and R=V/I,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15158,53410,"I'm getting zero, no matter what",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15159,53411,"Nevermind, now its at 12",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15160,53412,330+3R1=V/I,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15161,53413,then 110+R1=11/3*.03,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15162,53414,But I'm getting a reading of '1',SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15163,53415,They are attached to either side,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15164,53416,red on the left,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15165,53417,"Right now, I'm pointing to DCV, which is reading .28, while Amp reads 1",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15166,53418,if its at 120 then my voltage drop is at 2.78,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15167,53419,my voltage drop is 1.91,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15168,53420,or it was,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15169,53421,1.91 for me,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

15185,53437,im at 270 with 2.61,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15186,53438,next jump is 330 and changes mine to 3.02,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15187,53439,"Nvmd, mine went down to 2.36",SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15188,53440,im at 330,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15189,53441,At 120 with a reading of .88,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

15194,53446,need to be 3.21,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15195,53447,if i go down i get even further away,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15196,53448,"I'm at .68, needing .71",SSI-O,SSI-O,21

15219,53471,I=0.0114,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15220,53472,so your goal voltage / 0.0114 = resistor value in ohms,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15221,53473,390,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15222,53474,Ie my resistor is (7.73 V)/(0.0114 A),SSI-O,SSI-O,21

15395,53647,i got 1.9vdc with a 82 omh,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15396,53648,now im at 1.33vdc,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15397,53649,But it is suppose to = 8 Volts,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15398,53650,2 volts is the target,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15399,53651,I got 1.56,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15400,53652,Voltage Supplied Of 2V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15401,53653,we want 2v,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15402,53654,8V,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15403,53655,latter im thinking,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15404,53656,But we also have the other Resistor. Which is R0 with 100,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15405,53657,it would have a voltage drop of 3.05,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15406,53658,so we have 4.95 V left,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15407,53659,then we want 2V to be left over.,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15408,53660,Meaning we have 2.95V.,SSI-O,SSI-O,21
15409,53661,220 ohm,SSI-O,SSI-O,21

15467,53722,ok those two wires above the resistor,SSI-T,SSI-T,22
15468,53723,i don't think it's designed to do this,SSI-T,SSI-T,22
15469,53724,if you double tap on the resistor you can change the ohms,SSI-T,SSI-T,22

15494,53749,I don't exactly know,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15495,53750,The tutorial wasn't very clear and i've never seen a multi meter like this before,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15496,53751,To 20 volts I mean,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15497,53752,I'm not sure,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15498,53753,Ok I got a hang of this now,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15499,53754,wait that was R0,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15500,53755,I just relised that,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15501,53756,I accidentally used my voltage goal,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15502,53757,I don't  actually.,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15503,53758,I guess i didnt pay attention to the tutorials,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15504,53759,"Well, I am currently confused as to why I no longer have a voltage reading",SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15505,53760,maybe i typed something in wrong,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15506,53761,was wondering why it was so big,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15507,53762,there is something we are overlooking here,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15508,53763,"Sorry, E = E0 + E1 + E2 + E3",SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15509,53764,Wrong variable,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15510,53765,i just realized these go into megaohms,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15511,53766,there has to be a better way,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15512,53767,Ugh... I don't know a good way to do this,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15513,53768,"Also, I just realized that calculating the current when only one resistor is right won't help since it's not accurate then",SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15514,53769,I don,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15515,53770,nevermind. I forgot that we also have to get our goal voltages,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15516,53771,i don't remember the calc doesn't save memory,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15517,53772,nevermind. E=10,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15518,53773,idk,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15519,53774,idk what to do,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15520,53775,ohhhhhh i forgot abput R0 being a resistor,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15521,53776,i think,SSI-U,SSI-U,23

15600,53855,u good im so bad at all of this,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15601,53856,im still confused on how u got the current tho,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15602,53857,im still confused on how do all of this,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15603,53858,or no,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15604,53859,i dont recall doing this,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15605,53860,I made a mistake,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15606,53861,im not sure,SSI-U,SSI-U,23

15608,53863,idk wheere to start,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15609,53864,how do we do this problem,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15610,53865,i have no clue lol,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15611,53866,Lol. you should be able to do it Im trying stuff. Im not sure if i'll get it.,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15612,53867,I'm thinking,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15613,53868,Not sure why mine didn't work,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15614,53869,nvm thern,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15615,53870,damn I missed one decimal place,SSI-U,SSI-U,23

15617,53872,Idk that's strange,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15618,53873,"I really don't know why it's different, jokes aside",SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15619,53874,idk what to do with that information,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15620,53875,my brain is too slow,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15621,53876,i think i know how,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15622,53877,i know,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15623,53878,i made a mistake somewhere :(,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15624,53879,Thanks I think I finally understand,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15625,53880,Im not sure how to do this,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15626,53881,i don't know if the current measurement worked last time,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15627,53882,nm,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15628,53883,"good quesiton, i'm still not sure how you solved the last one",SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15629,53884,hmm alright i was wrong then,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15630,53885,I think,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15631,53886,hmm okay my ro is wrong,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15632,53887,i think i goofed it,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15633,53888,mine is very wrong,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15634,53889,I forget,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15635,53890,not sure,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15636,53891,like idk if amps should be 2.2 or .22,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15637,53892,So I don't know what I'm doing,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15638,53893,This is hard,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15639,53894,I'm so confused,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15640,53895,im thinking,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15641,53896,i feel like what we did shoulda worked,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15642,53897,This seems so wrong,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15643,53898,No clue,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15644,53899,nah nvm wrong number,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15645,53900,nvm,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15646,53901,maybe i calulated wrong,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15647,53902,problem is that I'm not sure if the current is correct,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15648,53903,i think,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15649,53904,nvm,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15650,53905,help,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15651,53906,I had some trouble. sorry.,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15652,53907,thats current i apologize,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15653,53908,I think we could do this faster now that we have the system figured out.,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15654,53909,oops,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15655,53910,hold on im messing up a little,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15656,53911,i'm the one thats probably messing up sorry,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15657,53912,idk,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15658,53913,im confused we got 3.24,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15659,53914,im so lost,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15660,53915,i cant figure it out,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15661,53916,i don't have a clue,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15662,53917,never mind that plan then,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15663,53918,im not sure of an accurate way to do this except for guessing from here,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15664,53919,dont know what to set my resistor to get 1.93 volts,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15665,53920,I don't know what to do,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15666,53921,Then if V= IR we take 2.64/0.024 and gives us 110 Ohms but there is only 100 and 120 resistors,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15667,53922,not sure if that is correct value. 622.38 volts,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15668,53923,sorry i meant 10 instead of 8,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15669,53924,nvm 1.94,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15670,53925,that doesnt make any sense,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15671,53926,idk why it changed,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15672,53927,im confused lol,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15673,53928,sorry at 5.4 V,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15674,53929,Im not 100% this will work btw :),SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15675,53930,i have no idea what im doing,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15676,53931,im sure the way to voltage is using I*R,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15677,53932,how to get the proper I eludes me,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15678,53933,ah i think i have an idea,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15679,53934,im lost in the sauce,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15680,53935,oh nvmd so you took the total volts for us and divided by total resistance for us correct,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15681,53936,sorry I got it mixed up last time,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15682,53937,idk,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15683,53938,Idk,SSI-U,SSI-U,23

15686,53941,dont do that,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15687,53942,i lost a decimal,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15688,53943,obviously wrong but I'm not sure why,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15689,53944,i might have made a calculator error,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15690,53945,i don't know why,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15691,53946,we have to many rounding errors,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15692,53947,well I don't know what's going on,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15693,53948,not sure,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15694,53949,"ok, im not sure what to do about that. this step only involves changing the resistance of the resistor so if that doesn't work then what...",SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15695,53950,ight nvm,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15696,53951,i think,SSI-U,SSI-U,23

15708,53963,i dont remember,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15709,53964,ahhh that makes sense,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15710,53965,I don't know how to do that,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15711,53966,ahah,SSI-U,SSI-U,23

15719,53974,wait no,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15720,53975,oh nvm i figured it out they looked like they were attached but the program didn't pick up on it,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15721,53976,hm idk why we are all getting different currents,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15722,53977,dunno guys,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15723,53978,honestly so lost rn,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15724,53979,I'm so confused,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15725,53980,I'm just confused on where we get the value of I,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15726,53981,then I get.0019 and i dont think that is right,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15727,53982,i dont know,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15728,53983,idk,SSI-U,SSI-U,23

15854,54109,nvm,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15855,54110,okay idk the math then because we dont have original voltage,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15856,54111,I can get it to 2.29 or 1.96 i dont know what else there is to edit,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15857,54112,this doesn't make sense,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15858,54113,nevermind that made it worse go down,SSI-U,SSI-U,23

15863,54118,i see,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15864,54119,i messed up on the equation the 8 and the 2 should be switched,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15865,54120,when i do the math is says 16 ohms which doesnt make sense,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15866,54121,not sure,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15867,54122,Ah fuck,SSI-U,SSI-U,23

15885,54140,i think,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15886,54141,wait nevermind idk because the measured voltage changes based on what we all put,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15887,54142,guess we'll never know,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
15888,54143,no clue,SSI-U,SSI-U,23
