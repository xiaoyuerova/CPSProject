81,i disconnect a wire and read the votalge on the meter,CEC-R
82,"me and circle have been changing our resistances, but I dont think triangle has been",CEC-R
83,i have been,CEC-R
84,i added our volts and that wasnt it,CEC-R
85,i legit have no clue. i tried it in ohms and that didnt work,CEC-R
86,i did,CEC-R
87,i am at 150 and changed the meater,CEC-R
88,then go higher. Ill go lower,CEC-R
89,ill stay put,CEC-R
90,im going up one,CEC-R
91,done.,CEC-R
92,Im gonna try one of the equation real quick,CEC-R
93,im just decreasing the resistor,CEC-R
94,I added all the voltages together to find the voltage of V0,CEC-R
95,Using the equation on the bottom right of the board,CEC-R
96,"Then when I found my voltage, I plugged in V0 for the top equation on the left",CEC-R
97,i went all the way to 10 to edit the resistor,CEC-R
98,Ill plug those in real quick and give you guys the ohms needed hold on,CEC-R
99,about to do mines,CEC-R
100,"I recalculated, I is 0.01533",CEC-R
101,i recalculated to 998,CEC-R
102,I might be able to counter-act it,CEC-R
103,ima do it and let me know,CEC-R
104,i wont,CEC-R
105,Maybe. I'm going to change my resistance,CEC-R
106,Eagle and I will fiddle with it,CEC-R
107,so i set my resistor to 100,CEC-R
108,done,CEC-R
109,lemme try increase myine,CEC-R
110,i just picked a random number,CEC-R
111,I set the the nob on 20 DCV and i have 4.18,CEC-R
112,did that my voltage is now 3.72,CEC-R
113,im trying to just figure it out,CEC-R
114,ill change mine slightly to see if we can get closer,CEC-R
115,i did,CEC-R
116,i went 120,CEC-R
117,i did,CEC-R
118,i did not,CEC-R
119,just did,CEC-R
120,i just did,CEC-R
121,went up one,CEC-R
122,i went to 2.31,CEC-R
123,did that,CEC-R
124,i am,CEC-R
125,im doing the math,CEC-R
126,"ok wait, everyone say their goal voltages again, lemme take a crack",CEC-R
127,I did!,CEC-R
128,i did like a milliion years ago,CEC-R
129,"I did, it says 6.82",CEC-R
130,click on the wires,CEC-R
131,okay i did that,CEC-R
132,i tried that as well>,CEC-R
133,"ok, i think i need a 220 ohm resistor. putting it in.",CEC-R
134,i put in 270 but my voltmeter still shows 0,CEC-R
135,i put mine in,CEC-R
136,i set mine to 56,CEC-R
137,i changed mine to 150 ohm,CEC-R
138,i changed mine to 180,CEC-R

144,I was trying values,CEC-R
145,Ill try doing some calculations,CEC-R
146,Im gonna drop a little bit,CEC-R
147,there now,CEC-R
148,done,CEC-R
149,ill try using reatios,CEC-R
150,I meant to change the resistance,CEC-R
151,okay done,CEC-R
152,done,CEC-R
153,done,CEC-R
154,Since the voltage drops are all the same since the Resistance is equal,CEC-R
155,i changed it to 330 and4.98,CEC-R
156,i did it try again,CEC-R
157,"820 is right i think, im there",CEC-R
158,I just bumped my resistance up to an extreme case,CEC-R
159,because i measured the amps again and it was different,CEC-R
160,I'll change it back,CEC-R
161,im changing it al ot,CEC-R
162,I thought I put it back to normal,CEC-R
163,I just set my resistor to 15,CEC-R
164,so ill drop mine alittle,CEC-R
165,Just changed it to 56,CEC-R
166,ill go up to 68,CEC-R
167,ill go up alittle,CEC-R
168,im changing my R now,CEC-R
169,i changed it to 100,CEC-R
170,im going to jump from 100 to 150 ohm now,CEC-R
171,i just can't,CEC-R
172,i clicked on it and then i cannot,CEC-R
173,let me calculate on scratch paper,CEC-R
174,I've switched my R to 220 ohms,CEC-R
175,I changed mine to 220 ohms as well,CEC-R
176,"I'm going to try to find the current based on that, then we should be able to calculate the remaining resistor values",CEC-R
177,"I had to mess with the leads a bit as well, they were not on when they appeared to be",CEC-R
178,I didn't change it.,CEC-R
179,I did to measure amperage.,CEC-R
180,ill do the math and yall can check me,CEC-R
181,Possibly but I'm not sure. I'll change mine now.,CEC-R
182,i changed mine,CEC-R
183,"i'm already did the calculation, the current 0.0222A",CEC-R
184,I did that,CEC-R
185,I put mine at 560,CEC-R
186,"so i just went from 560 to 470, and my voltage went down",CEC-R
187,I changed mine back to 220 and I'm at 2.15 and I need 2.18,CEC-R
188,I'll try going up,CEC-R
189,I cannged to 680 and I'm now at 5.35,CEC-R
190,let me tweek mine up and down and tell me what happens,CEC-R
191,I changed mine to 330,CEC-R
192,"Okay, mine is good",CEC-R
193,I'll lower mine,CEC-R
194,"I lowered mine some more, hopefully giving you guys some head room. What are your values now?",CEC-R
195,"I've just been lowering mine, I've hit 10 ohm",CEC-R
196,I raised mine up to 82 ohm,CEC-R
197,I dropped my resistance,CEC-R
198,im testing something,CEC-R
199,i raised my resistance,CEC-R
200,i have it entered,CEC-R
201,I am trying to spot match it,CEC-R
202,I'll drop mine and we'll what happens.,CEC-R
203,"Guitar, okay now I'll add mine in. 220 Ohms from me.",CEC-R
204,horn now just keep changing your resistance until you get to 4.25 V. It might work,CEC-R
205,I'll change mine to one setting lower.,CEC-R
206,Who's changing their resistor? I'm not touching mine.,CEC-R
207,i will,CEC-R
208,I changed mine to 3.9m Ohms and have 4.14 on mine.,CEC-R
209,i keep hovering between 1 and 4,CEC-R
210,Try changing it. I won't touch mine.,CEC-R
211,"Okay, I can't change it without it going out of bounds.",CEC-R
212,nevermind I got it,CEC-R
213,Not going to lie I'm just kind of playing guess and check with these resistor values,CEC-R
214,i changed mine to that,CEC-R
215,trying to figure out how to get e again,CEC-R
216,10.95 mA for current actually. needed to break the circuit,CEC-R
217,what i am going to do is break the circuit on my end and measure the current,CEC-R
218,i just put my circuit back together,CEC-R
219,alright ill keep mine together,CEC-R
220,ill keep mine together,CEC-R
221,okay no one touch anything and I will measure current,CEC-R
222,im going to leave mine at 560 ohms and 5.4 for now,CEC-R
223,okay so that gave me 398 but the closest resistance to choose from in 390 so i chose that and my meter is now reading 4.42,CEC-R
224,"ok aweseome, so now since lion got theres, i can get mine",CEC-R
225,hmm well i wont touch anything,CEC-R
226,so im going to use that as my current and change my resistance now and then i will tell you my voltage,CEC-R
227,already there,CEC-R
228,there,CEC-R
229,there,CEC-R
230,mines set,CEC-R
231,set,CEC-R
232,set,CEC-R
233,using 470??,CEC-R
234,let me try,CEC-R
235,using 330 ohms,CEC-R
236,3.86 at 390ohm gonna try back up to 470,CEC-R
237,i'll adjust next,CEC-R
238,ok ill change to 470,CEC-R
239,ok my next jump is to 560 which is 90 more who has the least jump in ohms,CEC-R
240,ill go up one resistor,CEC-R
241,i'll adjust,CEC-R
242,set,CEC-R
243,ok im going to adjust mine now 1 resistor at time,CEC-R
244,ill go up,CEC-R
245,I will,CEC-R
246,Okay I will try 390,CEC-R
247,okay so now i need to try to get my goal,CEC-R
248,1 sec I going to try to adjust mine I will try 270 then 390,CEC-R
249,I changed mine to 120 ohms and I'm close to 1.18 V: 1.12,CEC-R
250,okay let me try changing my resistance,CEC-R
251,ok I bump mine to 1k and really high now,CEC-R
252,Okay let me bump mine up,CEC-R
253,I need to raise mine,CEC-R
254,I was doing r/v=i which got me mixed up,CEC-R
255,That was me cuz i needed to to measure current. Our current is 10.18 millAmps,CEC-R
256,I tried: total R x I,CEC-R
257,okay stay there. next i'll increase mine,CEC-R
258,"just dropped to .77, let me try some others now",CEC-R
259,ok i changed to 560,CEC-R
260,i figured I based on my resistor and then calculated v on R0 using that.,CEC-R
261,i just plugged it back in,CEC-R
262,I calculated my resistance to be 390 ohms,CEC-R
263,I've connected mine,CEC-R
264,I'm doing the example he gave in class with 7R and 220 ohms etc,CEC-R
265,i changed the resistance to 180 Ohms on mine... dont know if yours is the same though,CEC-R
266,i changed mine to 560 ohms and now read 7.21 volts,CEC-R
267,I already did that several times. either way I go . Im too high or too low,CEC-R
268,I went low.,CEC-R
269,Ok. it changed mine too but not target goal,CEC-R
270,im going to 140. that was my too high,CEC-R
271,im doing the math from class today. almost done,CEC-R
272,okay so now i will try to change mine and see if yours changes to closer or further,CEC-R
273,im changing now to 220,CEC-R
274,i was trying to figure out how to arrange the resistors in my drowing,CEC-R
275,"give me a sec, ill calculate",CEC-R
276,I calculated the current for R1 to be 17.6mA,CEC-R
277,i used a 180 ohm resistor,CEC-R
278,that is what I calculated it should be around,CEC-R
279,i did 12- all of the other voltage drops we need,CEC-R
280,then divide that by 680,CEC-R
281,i changed mine to 100,CEC-R
282,It wont let me,CEC-R
283,I might've miss typed into the calc,CEC-R
284,I just added all those numbers together,CEC-R
285,I just added them...,CEC-R
286,doing that...,CEC-R
287,i entered 17v,CEC-R
288,i set my resistance to 150,CEC-R
289,i did,CEC-R
290,lol so i just stay,CEC-R
291,i need to lower my resistance and plum needs to increase resistance,CEC-R
292,um I found the voltage for R0 and then divided it by 330,CEC-R
293,Thats how i found the voltage^^,CEC-R
294,done,CEC-R
295,done,CEC-R
296,I entered the value for E,CEC-R
297,i did,CEC-R
298,ok i did 17-(3.76+2.09+9.48),CEC-R
299,i put it on the two wires and I'm at 2.62,CEC-R
300,i just disconnected mine,CEC-R
301,and put the reader on the two wires,CEC-R
302,done,CEC-R
303,i chose 330,CEC-R
304,i'll do it real quick,CEC-R
305,done,CEC-R
306,done,CEC-R
307,I fixed it,CEC-R
308,my bad i was just checking the current with the meter,CEC-R
309,alright i set mine to 470,CEC-R
310,"i set the resistance of mine to an arbirarily high value, so the other resistances will be insignificant",CEC-R
311,did that,CEC-R
312,i changed one band color to orange which was a lower number,CEC-R
313,ill go firsy,CEC-R
314,ok so me and dog move ohms down a bit,CEC-R
315,"it reset foe me, ill fix it",CEC-R
316,i can try changing mine,CEC-R
317,i left our RO,CEC-R
318,i just moved mine up and now im at 4.29,CEC-R
319,I haven't changed mine but now I'm at 1.38,CEC-R
320,here ill try,CEC-R
321,i can try going down one,CEC-R
322,i'll try,CEC-R
323,I went down to 120  ohms did that do anything,CEC-R
324,I went down to 1.49,CEC-R
325,ill do it,CEC-R
326,i went down one and now im at 3.95,CEC-R
327,same i clicked through the resistors to find one close to my goal but theres not one exact,CEC-R
328,that im changing the value of,CEC-R
329,let me change resistance,CEC-R
330,this is the closest i can get,CEC-R
331,let me do it again,CEC-R
332,i have  gone to a diifferent number to see if you lot can increase mine,CEC-R
333,im about to change,CEC-R
334,i changed my resistor to 270ohm,CEC-R
335,i increase mine to 470 and got a whole lot closer,CEC-R
336,increased my resistor,CEC-R
337,went back,CEC-R
338,gimmie a sec,CEC-R
339,dont ask me how was just messin around,CEC-R
340,i typed 17.47,CEC-R
341,i typed 17 V,CEC-R
342,idk what is right value but i am just trying to calculate it so that we have rough value,CEC-R
343,ight i went up one,CEC-R
344,I dont want to keep chanigng it if it's going to change others,CEC-R
345,I've been trying different numbers,CEC-R
346,Yeah i went up one when you went down,CEC-R
347,Ok I'm gonna give this a shot,CEC-R
348,i was adding 330 + my circuit + circuit 2 + circuit 3 for the total resistance,CEC-R
349,let me decrease mine,CEC-R
350,done,CEC-R
351,done,CEC-R
352,And I'll set it to 270,CEC-R
353,done,CEC-R
354,done my meter says 3.09,CEC-R
355,I disconnected my resistor from the board,CEC-R
356,no longer moving stuff,CEC-R
357,done,CEC-R
358,don,CEC-R
359,I need to go higher,CEC-R
360,Let me see.,CEC-R
361,done,CEC-R
362,Increased to 180 ohms and im sitting at 3.61V,CEC-R
363,I havent changed a thing,CEC-R
364,ah was left clicking,CEC-R
365,I literally did nothing for a solid 5 minutes,CEC-R
366,let me see if i can do addition,CEC-R
367,ill drop mine one down,CEC-R
368,im dropping,CEC-R
369,i went down so maybe go down with yours,CEC-R
370,try going up and well go down,CEC-R
371,i refreshed by accident,CEC-R
372,OK IM GONNA DECREASE MINE,CEC-R
373,im at 2.77 goin to 1.77,CEC-R
374,LET ME CHANGE MINE A LITTLE,CEC-R
375,cant go any higher,CEC-R
376,GONNA CHANGE MINE,CEC-R
377,i am,CEC-R
378,i am,CEC-R
379,im set,CEC-R
380,im going first,CEC-R
381,changed mine to 1k,CEC-R
382,just did,CEC-R
383,im good,CEC-R
384,there,CEC-R
385,just typing it,CEC-R
386,your lost i cant do shit,CEC-R
387,ive been trying the whole time and i cant get it to change,CEC-R
388,trying to calculate this shit,CEC-R
389,mines changed,CEC-R
390,i lowered mine to 120 cuz i was getting too hot,CEC-R
391,ok im going now,CEC-R
392,let me get some readings and ill do some math,CEC-R
393,ok ill try,CEC-R
394,i changed to 630r and im at 4.39 now,CEC-R
395,im gonna try the math,CEC-R
396,can you get any closer right now i just lowered my resistance,CEC-R
397,i opened the circuit,CEC-R
398,to measure current,CEC-R
399,closed again,CEC-R
400,ok ill adjust mine,CEC-R
401,ok plum adjust yours again,CEC-R
402,ok ill go again,CEC-R
403,let me try adjusting,CEC-R
404,ill try one more time,CEC-R
405,it brought mine to 4 something so i adjusted down one,CEC-R
406,im good,CEC-R
407,"so u guys can talk, ill just keep sending my value",CEC-R
408,ok ill try,CEC-R
409,ok ill try now,CEC-R
410,Got it i think. I just changed the resistor,CEC-R
411,i will change the resistor,CEC-R
412,ill take 680,CEC-R
413,thats what i have selected,CEC-R
414,Ima stay at 120,CEC-R
415,I moved upi to 150 and now im at 1.01 voly,CEC-R
416,I just switched the meter to amps,CEC-R
417,im going to 470,CEC-R
418,Because I took out my resistor and it read 15 volts,CEC-R
419,I'm leaving at 1k,CEC-R
420,Dropping mine from 560,CEC-R
421,I'll bump mine down one,CEC-R
422,i bump it up to 330 now,CEC-R
423,Bumping mine up one,CEC-R
424,i bump one down now,CEC-R
425,Bumping up,CEC-R
426,dropping to 8xxohm,CEC-R
427,Bumping down to 680,CEC-R
428,bumping back up,CEC-R
429,let me calculate,CEC-R
430,I did 3.78v/.0054870 and got 688.801Ohm,CEC-R
431,I did 3.97v (what the multimeter shows rn) divided by 390ohm (what the thing on the breadboard is rn),CEC-R
432,then divided my target voltage by .009718,CEC-R
433,moving mine from 390 to 330 puts me at 3.4,CEC-R
434,recalculated my current and it says my R should be 381ohm now,CEC-R
435,I'll go down one,CEC-R
436,I gotta go up,CEC-R
437,I didn't change,CEC-R
438,Gonna do 390,CEC-R
439,just did,CEC-R
440,im at 3.1 after i went up to 330ohms,CEC-R
441,dropping to 270 puts me back at 3.32,CEC-R
442,sorry i am calculating,CEC-R
443,let me calculate,CEC-R
444,I'm going back to 150,CEC-R
445,I'll just multiply it by 4,CEC-R
446,i rounded a few decimal places for reference,CEC-R
447,ok i'm locked in,CEC-R
448,well i tried a bunch of the usual; values for e and none worked,CEC-R
449,Set,CEC-R
450,done,CEC-R
451,okay im going to put my resistor up a notch,CEC-R
452,so let me put it at 270,CEC-R
453,done,CEC-R
454,i just went down from 220 to 180 and  our  voltage went down to 3.09,CEC-R
455,ill drop,CEC-R
456,i just dropped  to 150 and the voltmeter went to 2.95,CEC-R
457,so maynard and I have to increase  our r,CEC-R
458,just went to 220 and i am at 3.38,CEC-R
459,ok let me try again,CEC-R
460,ok just did that. my voltmeter now reads 7.50,CEC-R
462,set at 270,CEC-R
463,i entered it,CEC-R
464,i just set mine to max resistance and got 2.99,CEC-R
465,I just changed to 390 ohm,CEC-R
466,Am,CEC-R
467,changed mine,CEC-R
468,okay. let me change mine,CEC-R
469,done,CEC-R
470,i went down 1 and i'm at 3.5,CEC-R
471,im gonna go down one,CEC-R
472,im gonna do one more,CEC-R
473,done and 4.18,CEC-R
474,im going down 1,CEC-R
475,jk moving up 2,CEC-R
476,im gonna up 1,CEC-R
477,i went to 4.61 and then 4.88,CEC-R
478,done,CEC-R
479,i went up one and i'm reading 4.67,CEC-R
480,i'll go down,CEC-R
481,let me go up one more,CEC-R
482,done,CEC-R
483,i'll go up,CEC-R
484,went up 2 and i'm reading 5.47,CEC-R
485,i'm going down 1,CEC-R
486,done. i'm at 4.46,CEC-R
487,ill try going down i guess,CEC-R
488,done 4.28,CEC-R
489,i just increased to 120,CEC-R
490,i dropped to 1.63V,CEC-R
491,"k, I changed my resistance to 270 and now I'm at 2.93",CEC-R
492,done,CEC-R
493,am done,CEC-R
494,done,CEC-R
495,let me do that ok,CEC-R
496,i just tried 820 and it worked,CEC-R
497,LET ME TRY FIRST,CEC-R
498,waiting,CEC-R
499,okay done,CEC-R
500,Put mine on 120,CEC-R
501,let me try one more think,CEC-R
502,sorry i was trying to make a formula,CEC-R
503,alright im going to go down one notch,CEC-R
504,"it is, now its 3.09, gonna up it a bit",CEC-R
505,so blue's needs to go up. Green and i need to go down,CEC-R
506,ok i moved to 470 ohms,CEC-R
507,going down one more,CEC-R
508,bouta go down one more,CEC-R
509,So mine increased to 3.27,CEC-R
510,im going to try to increase my by one to see what happens,CEC-R
511,"ok, so you guys need to go up, i need to go down",CEC-R
512,let me move mine,CEC-R
513,i moved mine up one,CEC-R
514,i moved mine up,CEC-R
515,let me move mine real quick,CEC-R
516,ill go up one more,CEC-R
517,moved me down,CEC-R
518,im going up one,CEC-R
519,im going up one,CEC-R
520,i went up,CEC-R
521,moved up one,CEC-R
522,ill move up one now,CEC-R
523,im gonna try up 1,CEC-R
524,done,CEC-R
525,i went up one,CEC-R
526,i went down,CEC-R
527,ok i went down to 2.47,CEC-R
528,ok going up,CEC-R
529,i went up one,CEC-R
530,i went up 2,CEC-R
531,i went up,CEC-R
532,i went up,CEC-R
533,went back,CEC-R
534,imma go down one,CEC-R
535,ok so if i go down one you should go up,CEC-R
536,i went up,CEC-R
537,i went up one,CEC-R
538,ill go down one,CEC-R
539,hold on guys im doing the quick maths,CEC-R
540,I cant get close to 4.01,CEC-R
541,I can't change my resistor,CEC-R
542,I cant get close,CEC-R
543,keep yours the same. im going to go up one and down one,CEC-R
544,okay im going to move mine down towards 5.71. hang on,CEC-R
545,i am connected... just seeing what we go up to,CEC-R
546,im trying somemath here,CEC-R
547,mine wont move from zero,CEC-R
548,I'll see if moving mine will help. I'm at 470,CEC-R
549,I put mine on 390,CEC-R
550,I went to 390,CEC-R
551,i will go 470,CEC-R
552,changing one level up,CEC-R
553,i will try moving mine,CEC-R
554,ill go 390,CEC-R
555,I just went o 470,CEC-R
556,went back to 470,CEC-R
557,I moved mine up to 560,CEC-R
558,done,CEC-R
559,done,CEC-R
560,okat imma move mine up and see what happens cause im at 1.5,CEC-R
561,"i havent ,essed with mine im at 4.1 A and 1.8k",CEC-R
562,im leaving my resistance at 82. someone else leave theirs,CEC-R
563,i will leave mine at the same resistance,CEC-R
564,increase your resistance and us other two will adjust,CEC-R
565,I keep putting in,CEC-R
566,just changed mine to 680,CEC-R
567,just did,CEC-R
568,just did at 680 with 4.29,CEC-R
569,one sec ill adjust mine,CEC-R
570,i did 560 and got a voltage of 3,CEC-R
571,I set mine ot 330,CEC-R
572,Now 1.31 V but I did not change anything,CEC-R
573,I made mine 330 also,CEC-R
574,I'm summing up voltages now,CEC-R
575,I haven't changed anything yet so its' definitely me,CEC-R
576,I'm back where I started but I'm not changing anything till I get something on paper,CEC-R
577,i did and i still get nothing,CEC-R
578,I disconnected my resistor,CEC-R
579,didn't take leads out,CEC-R
580,i did,CEC-R
581,mine said 11.3 mA but now it says 0 and i didnt change anything,CEC-R
582,ive been doing that,CEC-R
583,But I just switched it to read voltage and its still at 0,CEC-R
584,i put my resistor at 100 just now,CEC-R
585,okay I'm changing my resistor from 680 to 270 so i can get closer to my goal,CEC-R
586,mine is higher now too. sleet keep yours the same. i'm gonna reduce my R by a little bit,CEC-R
587,i did that,CEC-R
588,let me try 680,CEC-R
589,i did and it says 3.24,CEC-R
590,I have no clue whats going on im just putting different resistances and hoping i get 7.16,CEC-R
591,"i did that too, not sure what to do with the number though",CEC-R
592,i need to go down,CEC-R
593,"at one point i had 1.05 with 27, so im going to leave mine",CEC-R
594,i hooked mine up and it says 4.34,CEC-R
595,i tried entering 14 and it was wrong,CEC-R
596,and i went down to 4.5,CEC-R
597,i did and im currently at .81,CEC-R
598,i just entered in my E starting from 1,CEC-R
599,I will,CEC-R
600,Has anyone found a value for I? Using E=IR I got I is 0.0255.,CEC-R
601,I selected the resistance given to me on the dropdown list but I'm getting 3.13V,CEC-R
602,I set my resistance to 39 ohms.,CEC-R
603,I was trying to think about the math...,CEC-R
604,me and hawk will chill until you get 2.5 V,CEC-R
605,okay. I'm gonna go up 1 level from where I am now,CEC-R
606,i went up to 120 ohms and 1.26 V,CEC-R
607,okay I went up a lot all the way to 270 ohms,CEC-R
608,i went down to 2.05 so I'm gonna go up 1 or two clicks,CEC-R
609,okay I did,CEC-R
610,i'm gonna go up one,CEC-R
611,i went up one and im now at 2.5,CEC-R
612,"I changed mine so im at 7.5 right now, change yours",CEC-R
613,I'll lower mine one,CEC-R
614,k i did and its at 3.35,CEC-R
615,"I had to up mine, it went down to 5 something once hawk changed",CEC-R
616,so let me go up 1,CEC-R
617,i went down to 330 ohms and am at 2.43,CEC-R
618,I went down one and now I'm at 6.34,CEC-R
619,i went up one and am at 2.92,CEC-R
620,exactly lemme calculate for you guys,CEC-R
621,i'm gonna drop mine a bit ad what happens,CEC-R
622,i dropped mine to 100 and my voltage stayed the same,CEC-R
623,i put it at the max resistance and nothing happened,CEC-R
624,i went back to 7 v,CEC-R
625,i just changed to maximum and no changes,CEC-R
626,i went back down to 6.99 V,CEC-R
627,I just set mine to 270 and its says 3.83,CEC-R
628,ill read the setting then yall respond with your reading,CEC-R
629,alright ill call em out,CEC-R
630,sorry i was messing around and unplugged the green wire,CEC-R
631,I set it to 180,CEC-R
632,"okay, let me try some things",CEC-R
633,OK WAIT I WANNA SEE SOMETHING,CEC-R
634,I need to go down,CEC-R
635,Im crunching numbers rn,CEC-R
636,Im not sure. That is what im trying to do,CEC-R
637,i got 4.5. I set the machine to 200 and changed the resistence to 220,CEC-R
638,"ill put mine to 18, both of you put yours at 22",CEC-R
639,ill choose 10,CEC-R
640,i just put mine to 180,CEC-R
641,i calculated the current,CEC-R
642,im trying to figure out a total R but im havin trouble,CEC-R
643,i cant get it there. theres a gap,CEC-R
644,i dropped mine to 100 ohms,CEC-R
645,when i put my multi meter across the two green wires (assuming that's the battery im getting 25),CEC-R
646,ive set my resistor to 12 ohms,CEC-R
647,I'm going to keep my resistor at 180 ohms,CEC-R
648,"Ok, I'll stop",CEC-R
649,going to 270 changes to 2.97,CEC-R
650,im at 1.89 volts rn so im going to raise mine now,CEC-R
651,if i change it o 220 it goes to 2.22,CEC-R
652,- just changed to 2.72,CEC-R
653,Red... could you try increasing yours and we will stay the same,CEC-R
654,now mine is at 2.88 but i havent changed anything,CEC-R
655,itll get us close and we can adjust from there,CEC-R
656,going to jump up one,CEC-R
657,im going to go back to 220 ohms,CEC-R
658,"still need to go up alot, so im going to go up to 270",CEC-R
659,going to up again since im the furthest,CEC-R
660,Maybe blue could make big changes and we can adjust accordingly,CEC-R
661,Setting my resistance to 820,CEC-R
662,My resistor is at 820 ohms and my voltage meter reads 5.77 I can't get it down .10,CEC-R
663,same i entered mine,CEC-R
664,"okay, i've set my resistor to 180 ohms and now my voltage is 1.43",CEC-R
665,I'm still trying to solve this,CEC-R
666,"changed, 220 now",CEC-R
667,i made my resistor 100 ohms and my drop is 1.94,CEC-R
668,I did,CEC-R

31661,everyone put 270 and then should be click we got it?,CMC-S
31662,that worked,CMC-S
31663,that worked for me,CMC-S
31664,so thats kinda close,CMC-S
31665,im at .86 so that didnt work,CMC-S
31666,it worked,CMC-S
31667,We were closer before,CMC-S
31668,I was just at my goal,CMC-S
31669,im at my goal,CMC-S
31670,I am again,CMC-S

31679,cause we all gave our goals met,CMC-S
31680,its not the sum of resistances,CMC-S
31681,i tried that and it didn't work,CMC-S
31682,I just got it by setting my resistance to 330 and the dial to 200 DCV,CMC-S
31683,I had it,CMC-S
31684,Mine is at 2.9. We are close.,CMC-S
31685,that seems too low for the data we have been getting,CMC-S
31686,680 ohms puts me nearly there at 3.89 v,CMC-S

31700,well that didnt work,CMC-S
31701,.28 is what we want,CMC-S
31702,pretty sure we are done,CMC-S
31703,now im at 2.61 which is pretty close,CMC-S

31706,submit,CMC-S
31707,There we go,CMC-S
31708,im close to my goal with a 330 ohm resistor (goal 2.2 at 2.14),CMC-S
31709,That throws me way off (too high),CMC-S
31710,I'm super close... at .7,CMC-S
31711,im at 220 ohms and no where close to goal (2.22 at 1.28,CMC-S
31712,"done, but still not close",CMC-S

31714,Okay yeah got it,CMC-S
31715,Okay done,CMC-S
31716,done,CMC-S
31717,I'm closer to 2.75 at 390 though,CMC-S
31718,damn its not right,CMC-S
31719,"okay, did anyone change anything to make their voltages incorrect?",CMC-S
31720,I think we all are good. I saw that Utah had the unknown value,CMC-S
31721,im at 820 ohms and its close,CMC-S
31722,I got it thanks,CMC-S
31723,"I got it, nice job guys",CMC-S
31724,i got it at 1k,CMC-S
31725,Everyone good?,CMC-S
31726,Close enough lol,CMC-S
31727,im at goal,CMC-S
31728,at goal,CMC-S
31729,at goal,CMC-S
31730,at goal,CMC-S
31731,3.5 is my output now,CMC-S
31732,i got it,CMC-S
31733,ok mine is right now,CMC-S
31734,Ok mine is too,CMC-S
31735,ok mine is .02 off,CMC-S
31736,ive got it,CMC-S
31737,Ok i got mine,CMC-S
31738,im as close as i can get,CMC-S
31739,i got mine,CMC-S
31740,got it,CMC-S
31741,finally,CMC-S
31742,so i'm on target,CMC-S
31743,i've had the right voltage on my dmm for a minute now,CMC-S
31744,im there exactly,CMC-S
31745,im on target exactly,CMC-S
31746,well was,CMC-S
31747,got the voltage right,CMC-S
31748,I got mine,CMC-S
33704,gj,CM-G
34214,i got 3.96,CM-G
34320,What are you hitting red?,CM-G
39398,im good now,CM-S
40793,so we we need a total V for all 3 resistors to be 12.75v,CP-G
40794,we need to figure out R0 and E first,CP-G
40795,But its the total voltage that needs to be calculated,CP-G
40796,it still finds total V which we need,CP-G
40797,we have to figure out I first,CP-G
40798,We can get E first,CP-G
40799,What is your resistance set at? We have to figure out voltage total,CP-G
40800,we have to all change our own resistors to and try to get 4V,CP-G
40801,we need to get current,CP-G
40802,we need our multimeters voltage,CP-G
40803,to = that,CP-G
40804,we are going to try to get 7.17 v,CP-G
40805,our goal is to the voltage drop to 2.75,CP-G
40806,we need to adjust the values of all the three resisters to do it,CP-G
40807,but we need to know the i,CP-G
40808,"then on the multimeter, we have to calibrate each of our resistors until we see a 2 on the multimeter on all our screens",CP-G
40809,oh so we have to make sure its 2,CP-G
40810,We need to find E,CP-G
40811,We need to find R0's V and add it to 5.93 I think,CP-G
40812,Now we just need to get our Voltages back,CP-G
40813,we need 2 volts,CP-G
40814,We r supposed to reach 3 volts but there is 12 volts going through all three circuits.,CP-G
40815,Aye so we all need 1578.94 volts,CP-G
40816,then we can find our resistance,CP-G
40817,we have to alter our individual resistors,CP-G
40818,get whataever volts it says at top,CP-G
40819,i think we need to find the resistance for all our resistors,CP-G
40820,So we just need R0,CP-G
40821,we need voltage for R0 to get Et,CP-G
40822,so now we need to add them for the total,CP-G
40823,we need to do the same thing as before,CP-G
40824,one of you needs the highest ohms,CP-G
40825,so the red device is the voltameter and we set it to DCV 20,CP-G
40826,So should we just have one person create a circuit on paper that the rest of us must follow?,CP-G
40827,I think we should submit an E value first,CP-G
40828,Then we can find V0,CP-G
40829,We need to stop guessing and  calculate the values,CP-G
40830,Mine and Norths resistance ratio need to be .56,CP-G
40831,Mine and West resistance ratio need to be .2635,CP-G
40832,we need to have combined 580,CP-G
40833,wait we need E now,CP-G
40834,we gotta calculate current right now,CP-G
40835,i think we might be able to just measure the current,CP-G
40836,i think we need to calculate the current since that is a constant,CP-G
40837,so i was saying we know v= 15. we know amps is 2.2. we need to solve the equation:,CP-G
40838,We need our VOLTAGE to be 3.75,CP-G
40839,so then the resitsnace we need for R1 is .022*R=3.5,CP-G
40840,"3.8 here too, we all need the same resistance",CP-G
40841,"well, its looks like we all need to go down in V's",CP-G
40842,Ok. We need to have the voltage drops accross all 4 resistors ad up to 3.5 volts.,CP-G
40843,All of the resistors need to be 820 in order to 1/4 the voltage,CP-G
40844,"so we all have to get the right R (numerator value) so that when we add them up, our chosen value of each of them over the total equals .25",CP-G
40845,so now we all are going to need different (R/RT) ratios,CP-G
40846,"I think because the power is in series with all three of our boards, we have to get the resistance right in order of each of us",CP-G
40847,we need E,CP-G
40848,wrench needs to be very low im at 820,CP-G
40849,we need find the voltage supply first. give me a sec,CP-G
40850,we have to find E,CP-G
40851,okay now we need to find E,CP-G
40852,we need to find the percent of voltage each of us needs to consume,CP-G
40853,we have to find E now,CP-G
40854,I think we all have to change ours till each one of our voltmeters says 2.5 on it..,CP-G
40855,now we just need to solve for R on each of our resistors,CP-G
40856,we need to calculate the initial current with Ro,CP-G
40857,circuit 1 needs to get the correct voltage first.,CP-G
40858,So let's figure out the R0,CP-G
40859,ok we need to find e first,CP-G
40860,we have to find a way to express r0 in terms of the values we do have,CP-G
40861,i think we need to make our resistance add up to 420,CP-G
40862,I think in total we need to equal 578,CP-G
40863,oh shoot we need to find e,CP-G
40864,Thats cause we all need the have the right ones I think to get the exact,CP-G
40865,we need to find the voltage for R0,CP-G
40866,im assuming we need to use formulas,CP-G
40867,ugh we just need I we have all the resistor values,CP-G
40868,you need to  plug in e at the botttom  so when you  get close,CP-G
40869,we should have same number. because sum of all voltage is overal voltage,CP-G
40870,we need to match our goal with our multimeter tho,CP-G
40871,yeah but one of you need to chnage,CP-G
40872,that was my question as well... I was trying to use I=E/R0+R1+R2+R3 but we still need I's values,CP-G
40873,okay well we need to agree on what our resistances will be,CP-G
40874,so we need to enter our own voltage,CP-G
40875,we need to find E,CP-G
40876,we need to find the current,CP-G
40877,we need to find E and I,CP-G
40878,"Ok. So now we have to balance it out.  So R1 is gonna have the biggest resistance, then R2, then R3.",CP-G
40879,Kinda... We have to all balance each other out.,CP-G
40880,But we need to make sure that we keep track of the total resistance,CP-G
40881,We need to figure out E,CP-G
40882,wwe have to fill in voltage at the bottom for this circuit,CP-G
40883,ok so i need to be at 1.55 volts,CP-G
40884,i think we have to connect one of the leads to the green part to find the voltage,CP-G
40885,so what was he saying we all need a different resistor,CP-G
40886,gotta find current first then its v over i,CP-G
40887,to find I are we just doeing 13v/1000,CP-G
40888,starting with 6v and we need to make 1.5v,CP-G
40889,And we have to calculate E it looks like,CP-G
40890,So we collectively gotta adjust our resistor to make the thing say 3.75v,CP-G
40891,We're trying to find our target total v,CP-G
40892,So now we have to find the Voltage first,CP-G
40893,And put it in the unknown,CP-G
40894,we should match that amps,CP-G
40895,So we really need to find E first then,CP-G
40896,I guess we need to find the current somehow.,CP-G
40897,we need 2.92 each while at equal Rs,CP-G
40898,but we need to report our changing V,CP-G
40899,we needed 8 something,CP-G
40900,we need to find an equivalent resistance  between the  3 of us that makes the voltage drop 3 v,CP-G
40901,so we have to measurte the current,CP-G
40902,we need a E,CP-G
40903,so we need equal resistance to divide it out evenly,CP-G
40904,i think we need to get close again,CP-G
40905,But we need to get the voltage to 2.75,CP-G
40906,We need all of our voltage to be the same,CP-G
40907,i think we need to strategist what makes it change,CP-G
40908,we need to calculate E,CP-G
40909,we need all values to calculate,CP-G
40910,i think we just need to find the different volts,CP-G
40911,thats what we need to find,CP-G
40912,"ok, now lets find our goals",CP-G
40913,hold on lets try and figure out what happens as we switch,CP-G
40914,we need to work on getting the higher one complete first before moving on to the smaller ones,CP-G
40915,we should have two people set theirs to 390 and one to 470,CP-G
40916,and vise versa,CP-G
40917,we need it to read 4.0,CP-G
40918,i feel like we need to be on 200 avc,CP-G
40919,someone changed something now im a7 3.5,CP-G
40920,we all need to use ohms law which is e=ir,CP-G
40921,our resistance needs to be equivalent to 737 ohms when added together.,CP-G
40922,we need to solve for E,CP-G
40923,nvm lol we want the red meter to just read 2.00 volts,CP-G
40924,we need the e and ro,CP-G
40925,The circuit across the bottom is what we have to make individually,CP-G
40926,We have to work together on the three resistors at the bottom,CP-G
40927,"ok that makes sense. with that, wee need to have the same value resistance",CP-G
40928,we have a total of 5.87V goal,CP-G
40929,I think we need a total of 606 ohms,CP-G
40930,we have to get to our goal voltage now,CP-G
40931,to find the current,CP-G
40932,we still have to find E,CP-G
40933,so we need to find the current,CP-G
40934,As far as I can we just need to get 3 volts.,CP-G
40935,i think we need to find that out,CP-G
40936,we want 4,CP-G
40937,we need to make all of ou resistances add up to 60,CP-G
40938,wait all of the individual voltage drops need to be 4.5,CP-G
40939,all of our meters have to add up to 1.75,CP-G
40940,so i talked to the TA and i think she was saying that all of our voltmeters need to equal 1.75 so seagull can you get yours to say 1.75,CP-G
40941,they should all be 2.75,CP-G
40942,So we all need to have resistors that sum up to have 2.75 volts across,CP-G
40943,"okay so every resistor needs to have 4.5 volts through it, including R0",CP-G
40944,just match your multimeter to your coal,CP-G
40945,we have to enter the resistor values again,CP-G
40946,We gotta figure out the supply,CP-G
40947,we need to figure out the resistor 0,CP-G
40948,whos the captain lol,CP-M
40949,okay stay there snow. Sleet go lower than 150. Ill go higher,CP-M
40950,Okay well circuit 1 needs to secure theirs,CP-M
40951,so that bear can then get theirs at 3.25,CP-M
40952,and then finally me,CP-M
40953,i would say me and green go up and blue go down,CP-M
40954,!st perso gets their value,CP-M
40955,then second,CP-M
40956,then me,CP-M
40957,well aybe we have one person up while the others stay at 100,CP-M
40958,so just keep messing with the different ohm sized,CP-M
40959,just make our resistor all 390,CP-S
40960,we could experiment with the higher resistances then,CP-S
40961,ok lets just set our resistor to 390,CP-S
40962,can you try the same,CP-S
40963,click on resistor and change the value if you want to,CP-S
40964,change value for r,CP-S
40965,we can try it,CP-S
40966,divide your voltage value by that current and shoudl give you your resistor value needed,CP-S
40967,we can use that to find E,CP-S
40968,easier way,CP-S
40969,everyone just set your R value to 180 ohms and read the voltage,CP-S
40970,divide your wanted voltage by .007,CP-S
40971,Set the resistor to 470 ohms and you will get 3.03V,CP-S
40972,You can use that to find the voltage over R0,CP-S
40973,You have to use the current to find V0 and add them,CP-S
40974,Take your specific voltage divided by your resistance,CP-S
40975,try going down again,CP-S
40976,I think we all need to go up higher again,CP-S
40977,maybe higher,CP-S
40978,maybe try one at a really small resistance,CP-S
40979,just have one person stay at a small resistance,CP-S
40980,go high up lettuce and tomato,CP-S
40981,so we gotta go highe,CP-S
40982,keeping going up,CP-S
40983,GO BACK,CP-S
40984,But try using that resistance to calculate current,CP-S
40985,"Use your resistance and your voltage to get the current. We know the formula, so we might be able to get E and work backwards",CP-S
40986,lets work back down and who ever gets their voltage first,CP-S
40987,find their current,CP-S
40988,"lets try 33ohms, 47, and 68",CP-S
40989,everyone set R to 100Ohms,CP-S
40990,"we can just measure the current, and use that to get E",CP-S
40991,everyone set to 1k again and check V,CP-S
40992,from here use goal voltages to find your R,CP-S
40993,everyone do 10ohms,CP-S
40994,"wait, do 30 ohms",CP-S
40995,"honestly, imma keep mine at 100 ohms. someone move there's around until it is like 2.7volts and then the third person can move it until we get it",CP-S
40996,go down in ohms,CP-S
40997,okay try it one more time,CP-S
40998,and well wait again,CP-S
40999,hold up everyone go 10 again,CP-S
41000,well maybe lets try it,CP-S
41001,try 680 lol,CP-S
41002,just try,CP-S
41003,everyone try 100,CP-S
41004,so go a bit lower,CP-S
41005,start at  220,CP-S
41006,try 220,CP-S
41007,try 330,CP-S
41008,"same, lets just increment our way up",CP-S

41010,everyone go to 390,CP-S
41011,lets try,CP-S
41012,everyone go to 180,CP-S
41013,one stays at 150,CP-S
41014,So let's try calculate it first and then do it,CP-S
41015,everyone set their resistors to 180 ohms,CP-S
41016,multiply ur volts by 168.5,CP-S
41017,then change to that number,CP-S
41018,go back down,CP-S
41019,everyone multiple your goal by 140.0560224089636,CP-S
41020,You guys can put 1000,CP-S
41021,Set to 820,CP-S
41022,We can disconnect all resistor to get E,CP-S
41023,"connect all resistors, set to 10",CP-S
41024,make sure and place the leads on the resistor first,CP-S
41025,everyone set your resistor to 180 ohm,CP-S

41041,erry body set your R to 270,CP-S
41042,set it to 560 please and thank you,CP-S
41043,then we need to go to 680,CP-S
41044,disconnect the rest from bread board and put black  probe on e end of the rest and the black on other,CP-S
41045,to unhook click the wires of the rest,CP-S
41046,someone move to 180,CP-S
41047,Try a 470 ohm resistor,CP-S
41048,raise your resistor by about 100 ohms,CP-S
41049,"divide your voltage by your resistor value, what do you get?",CP-S
41050,Enter 15 voltsl,CP-S
41051,everyone try 220,CP-S
41052,everyone put your resistor at 270 ohms,CP-S
41053,try 470 ohms on your resistor,CP-S
41054,I think we need to change gradually possibly on at a time. right now I'm reading 0.89 at my resistor.,CP-S
41055,Can you try increaseing your resistor?,CP-S
41056,tryy raising your r value,CP-S
41057,make your resistors,CP-S

41060,multiply your voltage,CP-S
41061,by .0128,CP-S
41062,just round,CP-S
41063,lets all do 13v,CP-S
41064,voltage,CP-S
41065,divided by .13,CP-S
41066,go,CP-S
41067,use the probes,CP-S

41072,red on left,CP-S
41073,open your multimetere,CP-S
41074,set it on 200ohms,CP-S
41075,go to dcv,CP-S
41076,then we can move it down to the 200 ohms,CP-S
41077,and get our resitors values,CP-S
41078,and up our resistor values,CP-S
41079,and then divide by the curret,CP-S
41080,multiply,CP-S
41081,and get e total,CP-S
41082,play with yuor resitors,CP-S
41083,and make this = 13.65,CP-S
41084,put your probes on ur resistors,CP-S
41085,and do 20v,CP-S
41086,and play with it,CP-S
41087,till it equals your voltage drop,CP-S
41088,you guys need to decrease your resistance,CP-S
41089,Try to increase the resitance,CP-S
41090,some make their r= 47,CP-S

41093,Keep increasing ur ohms,CP-S
41094,Dont go below 680 ohms,CP-S
41095,try to lower it down to 2,CP-S
41096,lets try tht,CP-S
41097,set yours at 2.2,CP-S
41098,so what we have to do is set it at 20,CP-S
41099,can u guys turn the multimeter to 20??,CP-S
41100,evryone put resistor to 1M,CP-S
41101,ok everyone to 470 then,CP-S
41102,can some1 go down a tiny bit,CP-S
41103,can some1 go up a tiny bit,CP-S
41104,go back,CP-S
41105,try the resistance under it and if that does not work then the resistance above it.  If your values are close it should be one of those and idk,CP-S
41106,try 680?,CP-S
41107,well its just guess work so keep changing it,CP-S
41108,Set the multi meter to voltage,CP-S
41109,everyone set their resister to 120 and see what happens,CP-S
41110,lets all set it to 150 and see what it reads first,CP-S
41111,try connecting to each of the green wires,CP-S
41112,try 120,CP-S
41113,everyone go to 150 and then me and curciut one will go up/ down one and keep doing that until we get it,CP-S
41114,go to 180,CP-S
41115,go to 180,CP-S
41116,we have to change the resistance,CP-S
41117,then we find the new resistance to make the voltage equal to 2,CP-S
41118,go to 220,CP-S
41119,try 47,CP-S
41120,go to 100,CP-S
41121,try 15resistance,CP-S
41122,on the digital mm make sure the knob is on DCV 20,CP-S
41123,can you go to 330?,CP-S
41124,divide your goal voltage by .011899 to find resistance,CP-S
41125,Everyone try to make all of your resistors equal to 100ohms,CP-S
41126,try 270k,CP-S
41127,hey go back!,CP-S
41128,K so we all hav the same one try 1.8k,CP-S
41129,Now go up one,CP-S
41130,Lets try one more,CP-S
41131,Keep messin with numbers,CP-S
41132,divide the R0,CP-S
41133,then use your goal voltage to get your R,CP-S
41134,change it to 120,CP-S
41135,same method,CP-S
41136,find V0 first,CP-S
41137,then divide by R0,CP-S
41138,use your voltage divide 0.0153,CP-S
41139,change your resistance to that value,CP-S
41140,would you find your R,CP-S
41141,would you change it to the value,CP-S
41142,would you enter the E at the bottom of the chat window?,CP-S
41143,put it at 150,CP-S
41144,which means that we have to all adjust our resisters accordingly,CP-S
41145,go to 180,CP-S
41146,go to 2.2 K,CP-S
41147,Everyone else go to 10 and we can work our way up,CP-S
41148,go to 220,CP-S
41149,go to 470,CP-S
41150,go to a lower number then,CP-S
41151,I think we need to solve for E using Ohm's Law,CP-S
41152,put your R to 820,CP-S
41153,double click on the R,CP-S
41154,change to 820,CP-S
41155,use your V divide 0.0057 for R,CP-S
41156,throw ur leads on resistor,CP-S
41157,put 150 ohm resistor,CP-S
41158,go 180,CP-S
41159,basically add all our voltages,CP-S
41160,subtract from ET,CP-S
41161,start multiplying by resistors till u get ur goal,CP-S
41162,so divide your goal voltage with 6.6 mA and that should be your resistance,CP-S
41163,both of you go 1 higher ill go 1 lower,CP-S
41164,one of yall has to go up,CP-S
41165,one of you two need to go up,CP-S
41166,you guys go up one at a time and lets see what it does,CP-S
41167,put 8 volts in the sqare,CP-S
41168,put 8 and Volts for the unknown value,CP-S
41169,"0.01 off, someone needs to adjust",CP-S
41170,iowa and i have to adjust,CP-S
41171,someone move theirs down by one,CP-S
41172,we might have to guess,CP-S
41173,we should all be at 470,CP-S
41174,divided by battery voltage,CP-S
41175,try it,CP-S
41176,let's find V,CP-S
41177,"everyone, make ya R 100",CP-S
41178,try it,CP-S
41179,so divide your goal voltage by that and put in that resistance,CP-S
41180,okay so same as before?,CP-S
41181,make all our resistors the same,CP-S
41182,find the right one that works with 120 ohms,CP-S
41183,try 120,CP-S
41184,we can then use current to find resistance,CP-S
41185,also make sure your resistor is actually plugge din,CP-S
41186,we should all start with 680 ohm resistors and then find the current through the measured voltage?,CP-S
41187,lets all put in 100 ohm resistors in for a minute.,CP-S
41188,i mean we can find the current right now,CP-S
41189,quickly start increasing your resistances,CP-S
41190,increase a bit more,CP-S
41191,should we try guessing voltages,CP-S
41192,i think we all need to go down abit,CP-S
41193,do 120 then 240,CP-S
41194,we can go from there,CP-S
41195,so lets find the current,CP-S
41196,and use V = IR to find our resistances,CP-S
41197,"So V = 5.8, I = .03333, and you solve for R = V / I",CP-S
41198,so we add all our voltages required and subtract it from 11V(total EMF). then we divided that Voltage with 330 ohms and that's the correct current of the circuit,CP-S
41199,set the R to 560 ohms,CP-S
41200,just try,CP-S
41201,let's see if it works,CP-S
41202,lets find E,CP-S
41203,Put in your current volts,CP-S
41205,same thing change resistor value to 820,CP-S
41206,"Divide the voltage value you need by that number,and thats your resistance valuea",CP-S
41207,Alright lets set E equal to 12volts just for reference,CP-S
41208,Divide your voltage by .0242 and set that to be your resistor,CP-S
41209,The thing is we might need to choose a different E to get our value,CP-S
41210,Lets try 16 volts for E,CP-S
41211,The thing is we can find v0 if we just take a known battery voltage as a reference to find current,CP-S
41212,every body bring it up 1 values,CP-S
41213,wait nobody touch anything what is everybodys resistor values,CP-S
41214,up to 470,CP-S
41215,guys enter 7 volts for the unknown in the box below,CP-S
41216,"ok, let's math this",CP-S
41217,everyone go to,CP-S
41218,"ok, let's go 1 option down",CP-S
41219,everyone try 1000,CP-S
41220,everyone divide your voltage by the current,CP-S
41221,"i think we have to use the same resistance, add it up, and find the current",CP-S
41222,lets do 100 Ohms,CP-S
41223,you have to submit the battery voltage first,CP-S
41224,everyone to 100 ohms again?,CP-S
41225,everyone calculate current through their thingy,CP-S
41226,we gotta make 2 equations,CP-S
41227,the first one we have is the following,CP-S
41228,everyone go to 220 Ohms,CP-S
41229,i got the resistance with the equation with the 0.0208 amps. but to find our own resistances we gotta get another one,CP-S
41230,lets figure out our current first,CP-S
41231,well we can't change v or r0,CP-S
41232,Originally i thought we could subtract all the voltages we know as our goals and then we would have some left over value,CP-S
41233,one of you need to enter that on the bottom right of the screen,CP-S
41234,some one needs to type in 19,CP-S
41235,all go to 470,CP-S
41236,ohhh try 870,CP-S
41237,don't change anything real quick,CP-S
41238,so for this i think we need to set up a system of equations where when we change the voltage we need to calculate the total voltage and set it equal to each other and then find current,CP-S
41239,okay so now one of us need to change their voltage,CP-S
41240,do it,CP-S
41241,and then put everyones new values in the chat,CP-S
41242,well we can try one then the other,CP-S
41243,so do 0.086 first,CP-S
41244,do it,CP-S
41245,use ohms law to see what r needs to be to get the correct v,CP-S
41246,i mean we can try that until we get something that makes sense,CP-S
41247,ok lets try to use ohms law,CP-S
41248,Set r1 is 170,CP-S
41249,Let's all go up to 82 and see what happens,CP-S
41250,"Unhook the two green wires, and then place your probes on them, then change your meter to measure mA, I believe",CP-S
41251,"Lets let Hawk gets theirs right first, and we can move down the circut",CP-S
41252,Lets all go down in R so we can change by smaller increments,CP-S
41253,we can try to work around,CP-S
41254,so you can try to use I = 0.005Amp,CP-S
41255,try E = 10.57V,CP-S
41256,ok move on!,CP-S
41257,then you guys have to change your R,CP-S
41258,everybody stop changing the resistance,CP-S
41259,I think one person should do the calculations and tell the rest what to do so we aren't switching it on eachother. What do you think?,CP-S
41260,if that is the case you can click on the reisistor to change the value,CP-S
41261,We first need to use what data we have to calculate the total circuit resistance. From there we can calculate what each of our resistor values should be to obtain our goal voltage.,CP-S
41262,"try to chose 1k resistor and measure it if the voltage not as your goal, change the resistor",CP-S
41263,someone drop their resistance one by one,CP-S
41264,and then change it back to 270,CP-S
41265,Lets try and get 6.8,CP-S
41266,everyone disconnect your resistors.  I have a plan,CP-S
41267,now attach to the multimeter and see if any value is given,CP-S
41268,when everyone has theirs changed type what your voltage value is,CP-S
41269,so lets try all going down one value on our resistors and see what happens,CP-S
41270,change your risistors to 470,CP-S
41271,"multiply the percentage of your voltage goal by the total voltage, then multiply that by 1100",CP-S
41272,someone increase theirs by 1,CP-S
41273,"same, we need to enter 13 for the unknown value",CP-S
41274,"Okay, everyone set theirs to 10 ohm and we'll start from Guitar, then Piano, then Horn.",CP-S
41275,someone go down on their resistor,CP-S
41276,we can try it,CP-S
41277,Lets all bump up to 150 and see what it does,CP-S
41278,change to 390 on all resistors,CP-S
41279,try 120,CP-S
41280,Let's just try 14v haha,CP-S
41281,"ok how about this, we all break the circuit between the wire and one end of the resistor and measure current at the same time",CP-S
41282,"so, once lion figures out the proper voltage then i can find mine with the voltage lion gives me.",CP-S
41283,"I was thinking that once we know total current, we can use I*R=V and solve for R",CP-S
41284,what if we did 11-all of our voltages so we knew R0s voltage and since we know its resistance find the current,CP-S
41285,"the other option would be to have lion go first and get the proper voltage, then me, then tiger.",CP-S
41286,A less volatile way imo is to add our resistances and R0,CP-S
41287,then we do V/R to find total circuit current,CP-S
41288,and just get as close as possible,CP-S
41289,thats why i was saying we should use the 11-3.85-.83-5.64 and then would have their voltage and then just take that voltage and divide it by their resistance which is 100,CP-S
41290,lets try that,CP-S
41291,lets rerun the numbers with that,CP-S
41292,lets run with it,CP-S
41293,lets try it,CP-S
41294,"lets all set our R to 680??, then 4*our V will be the source",CP-S
41295,so take it with the target V,CP-S
41296,change back,CP-S
41297,re run the #,CP-S
41298,set resistors to 10,CP-S
41299,keep your resistors at 10 ohms,CP-S
41300,well i guess thats not gonna work so we can all try to get to our need values,CP-S
41301,so we need to let each other know when we will make a change,CP-S
41302,I guess we could find that out,CP-S
41303,try that,CP-S
41304,round it to 17,CP-S
41305,everyone just enter 17,CP-S
41306,Someone needs to change their resistor. Is everyone at 680?,CP-S
41307,find total resistance based on the 1000 ohm resistor and figure the rest based on that...or just guess,CP-S
41308,everyone leave everything the same for a minute,CP-S
41309,someone else should try,CP-S
41310,i was thinking if we could add all of our individual voltages together we could get E but we'd still be missing R0's amps,CP-S
41311,im obviously thinking about this wrong. we can figure out v based on percentage now thouygh,CP-S
41312,"So, by using Ohm's law, the current for the circuit should be approximately 0.01524242424242424 A. So, we should be able to calculate the requred resistance for each of our resistors based on that number.",CP-S
41313,"Well, current on the multimeter and the calculate voltage",CP-S
41314,everyone needs to keep their wires connected except for 1 person,CP-S
41315,the odd one out removes the wires from the bread board and measures the voltage,CP-S
41316,"What I'm saying is we pull the green cords to take out the resistors, use our multimeters to provide a connection (set to find amps), and we find the current without our resistors and use the resistance on R0 to find voltage",CP-S
41317,so we all need to pull the green cords out,CP-S
41318,okay we can try it,CP-S
41319,and connect the multimeter,CP-S
41320,ok new plan,CP-S
41321,literally all you do ( i think) is connect the leads and set the meter to voltage,CP-S
41322,all you do is click the resistor to change it,CP-S
41323,false. hasn't budged. maybe we need to try something else,CP-S
41324,disconnect the jumper cables,CP-S
41325,and reconnect,CP-S
41326,refresh the browser. oh well,CP-S
41327,"Move it up or down, it is going to be too low or too high. but move adjust it and leave it there and see if it has an effect on ours and then we can adjust accordingly",CP-S
41328,just connect everything together and change youre resistance....,CP-S
41329,go to 390,CP-S
41330,OK skillet you measure the current through your side and us other two will not touch anything,CP-S
41331,try it now,CP-S
41332,go to 180 ohm,CP-S
41333,wait everyone go to 150,CP-S
41334,all you ha to do was calulate the voltage drop acros R0,CP-S
41335,ight so we can measure the in voltage,CP-S
41336,So R1 should be able to calculate its required resistance for required voltage.,CP-S
41337,Then R2 can find its current and then calculate its resistance to get the required voltage.,CP-S
41338,measure to make sure tho,CP-S
41339,just do the 20 m setting,CP-S
41340,lets try,CP-S
41341,Click \,CP-S
41342,click \,CP-S
41343,You have to break the circuit,CP-S
41344,Make sure only one of you has a wire pulled at a time,CP-S
41345,"Tiger, can you connect your wires? then we can measure our voltages",CP-S
41346,"Okay, try 100 ohms then",CP-S
41347,and put your wires in so we can check,CP-S
41348,Make sure you enter the 17 volts,CP-S
41349,click pn the colored markings,CP-S
41350,click on it,CP-S
41351,everyone set theirs to 150,CP-S
41352,then everyone needs to divide their voltage by .0086,CP-S
41353,we all set resistance to 120 then see the reading on the voltmeter,CP-S
41354,so everyone divide their voltage by the current,CP-S
41355,lets try 0.01391 first,CP-S
41356,just try using 0.09178,CP-S
41357,lets try setting all of our resistors to 220,CP-S
41358,then we just divide our respective voltages by that to get our resistance for each,CP-S
41359,yeah we can break the circut,CP-S
41360,we should all set our resistances to 0 or something for easy calculation,CP-S
41361,we can measure the voltage drop with the multimeter,CP-S
41362,set it to about 70 ohm,CP-S
41363,now that we have E we can treat this like the last step,CP-S
41364,so divide your voltage by that value and we should all get it,CP-S
41365,well there's 120 and use 2 10's,CP-S
41366,try 220,CP-S
41367,ok lets have each person increase the resistance until we get as close to 3.25 as possible then the next person can try to get closer and so on,CP-S
41368,*decrease resistance,CP-S
41369,bump your resistance up to 330 and we can go from there,CP-S
41370,lets all try 560 and see what happens,CP-S
41371,ok lets all go to 680 now,CP-S
41372,go to 680 guys,CP-S
41373,I say we just mess around with it like last time,CP-S
41374,whoever is furthest off change yours to correct it,CP-S
41375,so we all need to be a little lower,CP-S
41376,actual math now :/,CP-S
41377,everyone just solve for your own voltage and we can add it up,CP-S
41378,can someone try changing their resistor again,CP-S
41379,try dividing your goal by 0.0171,CP-S
41380,and then pick the closest resistor to that value,CP-S
41381,someone move theirs up or down 1,CP-S
41382,try using the numbers that we found individually because if I is the same throughout the circuit we should all get the same answer,CP-S
41383,everyone try doing I=V/R with the numbers from your own circuit,CP-S
41384,see if you get .0086470,CP-S
41385,"oh, I mean lets try it and see if we get it right",CP-S
41386,go down,CP-S
41387,so try and get close and then let me know when you are around and we can figure it out,CP-S
41388,iowa you go while me and ohio stay and you try and get close then we will take turns we we dont fuck up either persons reading,CP-S
41389,you lot need to change your vallue and stay there and i will try and get you up to it,CP-S
41390,we go one at a time and then after each of us have gone we stay if we need to go high or lower to reach the target,CP-S
41391,lets try having yall go down,CP-S
41392,aye let's hear it,CP-S
41393,remember you value,CP-S
41394,aye peeps right down your answers,CP-S
41395,We can try adding up all the resistances,CP-S
41396,Let's try that. Mine was 390 ohms,CP-S
41397,Lets try it,CP-S
41398,lets try it!,CP-S
41399,Lets try hammers idea of IxR0 + IxR1,CP-S
41400,lets try,CP-S
41401,Let's try it!,CP-S
41402,We should divide our voltage goal by the resistor value we have to find the current that is the same throughout the circuit. Then plug in E=IxR0 + IxR1 + IxR2 + xR3. because then we will have the same I value across the whole circuit to use,CP-S
41403,"Wait guys, for your resistor, calculate what you get for V1/R1 or V3/R3.",CP-S
41404,and then we should be able to get E if our math is correct,CP-S
41405,okay now we should be able to plug that value into the E=IxR0 + IxR1 + IxR2 + IxR3 equation and get E!,CP-S
41406,Was literally typing out if we guess and check enough we will get it hahahha,CP-S
41407,lets all change our resistances to 270 and see if it tells us we succeeded,CP-S
41408,so we need to decrease,CP-S
41409,okay lets use our ohms law knowledge to figure this out,CP-S
41410,well we'll have to use V=IR,CP-S
41411,i think we just need to obtain our needed voltage and then do the math for E,CP-S
41412,get that first then E,CP-S
41413,try whatever,CP-S
41414,we need to do this in sequence,CP-S
41415,go down,CP-S
41416,raise your resistance a little bit and see where it puts you,CP-S
41417,so we need to do a reverse process to find the E before its decreased by r0,CP-S
41418,look so when we find the total E we can pllug it into V=IR to find the resistance that we each need',CP-S
41419,so now we need to do the math,CP-S
41420,Let's start with R1,CP-S
41421,We have to adjust our resistance so that the current increases,CP-S
41422,So we need to make our resistances higher,CP-S
41423,To find the current we have to add up all of our resistances plus R0,CP-S
41424,Ok. Let's all set our resistance to 270,CP-S
41425,So we have to adjust to each other,CP-S
41426,Let's try this:,CP-S
41427,We should settle on a total resistance,CP-S
41428,"So the way we do it is make sure that as we adjust, all three of us add up to 1000 ohms",CP-S
41429,Ok. We have to make it to where all 3 of us add up to 100,CP-S
41430,"Ok. To find E, we need to disconnect all of our resistors and connect our voltmeters.",CP-S
41431,Everyone set your resistance to 100,CP-S
41432,do 470 ohms,CP-S
41433,"Everyone try setting the resistence to 100, that should get us to 4.7 volts",CP-S
41434,Divide your goal by the current which is .0085,CP-S
41435,this is trial and error now. Fries keep going up,CP-S
41436,someone try upping the resistance by one step,CP-S
41437,add 180 to 680,CP-S
41438,or add up uor volts,CP-S
41439,that increased it lets try a different ohm,CP-S
41440,drop yours one down,CP-S
41441,drop yours,CP-S
41442,double click r1,CP-S
41443,lets all drop to 100 ohms and see what happens,CP-S
41444,so increase ohms,CP-S
41445,we just have to do the same thing weve been doing then at the end will add it up for the voltage,CP-S
41446,bear go up one,CP-S
41447,now lets find e,CP-S
41448,maybe divide,CP-S
41449,try it out,CP-S
41450,put in your resistance,CP-S
41451,MEASURE YOUR VOLTAGE,CP-S
41452,decrease resistance,CP-S
41453,once we find our resistance we have to find current,CP-S
41454,everyome set your resistor to 120,CP-S
41455,look at the power formula,CP-S
41456,everyome go to 10,CP-S
41457,everyone go to 100,CP-S
41458,staay at 100,CP-S
41459,go to 220,CP-S
41460,change to 820,CP-S
41461,starrt at 1k,CP-S
41462,then we have to take the total,CP-S
41463,everyoe set to 1k,CP-S
41464,we are going to have to experiment,CP-S
41465,so i think we need to keep our resistance at one point and calculate the current,CP-S
41466,everyone set to 820 ohms,CP-S
41467,everyone got to 1k,CP-S
41468,everyone stay at 1k,CP-S
41469,ok so everyone vhange it to 820,CP-S
41470,lets all start at 1k resisitor,CP-S
41471,then we add all of those to find r0,CP-S
41472,lets try 180 150 120 tim go 180 chris go 150 ill go 120,CP-S
41473,do 180 and try it,CP-S
41474,i got 300 so lets try 330,CP-S
41475,can everyone change their resistor to 1k real fast,CP-S
41476,one person needs to change theres around util they get their v,CP-S
41477,then the next person will go,CP-S
41478,everyone type 15 volts,CP-S
41479,type 15 at bottom,CP-S
41480,ok we are adjusting,CP-S
41481,"every one get a fixed resistor, and one person can change his resistor to get a fixed voltage",CP-S
41482,can someone change their resistor value,CP-S
41483,math time,CP-S
41484,lets try it,CP-S
41485,somebody change somthing,CP-S
41486,or any of you change resistance,CP-S
41487,put 12 in unknown,CP-S
41488,okay so let's make all of ours 820 ohms,CP-S
41489,try going down a value,CP-S
41490,some one bump theirs up one,CP-S
41491,So someone bump theirs down one resistor,CP-S
41492,Other way,CP-S
41493,everybody change it to 220,CP-S
41494,Everyone try 560,CP-S
41495,Someone bump theirs up one,CP-S
41496,use our goal voltage divide it,CP-S
41497,divide your voltage by the current,CP-S
41498,Take your resistor value and the voltage on the red thing and calculate the current,CP-S
41499,hold on everyone switch the multimeter to the amp side for 200MU,CP-S
41500,try this,CP-S
41501,Go up real quick,CP-S
41502,it is ok try 270,CP-S
41503,alright someone go down now,CP-S
41504,other way other way,CP-S
41505,alright go up one again,CP-S
41506,other way other way,CP-S
41507,every one check the 20m setting first,CP-S
41508,every one make there resistance 390,CP-S
41509,now check the amps,CP-S
41510,then just plus voltage together,CP-S
41511,go back to 390 and everyone check ther voltage,CP-S
41512,then we'll sum all our V's together,CP-S
41513,ok add them up,CP-S
41514,just take your goal V and divide by .007805,CP-S
41515,let's measure the current I and find V,CP-S
41516,check amps again,CP-S
41517,"nvm, do 1k and we'll see",CP-S
41518,"ok, so now like before, solve v+ir for goal",CP-S
41519,ok so lets try that with ohms law then,CP-S
41520,So we should use the current coming out of R0,CP-S
41521,lets work from there then same as before,CP-S
41522,set all same ohms,CP-S
41523,and we distributer around until we get our values,CP-S
41524,so we need to increase our voltage drop total by 2.4 V,CP-S
41525,someone bump up their resisotr one notch,CP-S
41526,we have 3.09 total voltage we have to go down by .09,CP-S
41527,we gotta go down,CP-S
41528,so someone else drop your resistor,CP-S
41529,"lets all go to 220, see what happens",CP-S
41530,so we need to calculate the voltage drop over each and use to calculate our invidual resistor value,CP-S
41531,so we have to go in order since what ever circuit 1 is will effect the later,CP-S
41532,we can use that to get a current and then adjust your value to hit that voltage,CP-S
41533,now we go to circuit 2,CP-S
41534,everyone set to 270,CP-S
41535,pick your resistance off of that,CP-S
41536,someone needs to enter the unknown value,CP-S
41537,everyone go to 100 ohms,CP-S
41538,set to maximum resistance,CP-S
41539,try 1M,CP-S
41540,"if we all have the same r we should be good (16/4=4), so set em to 150",CP-S
41541,set it to 150,CP-S
41542,you can guess and check from there but r1 needs to go first,CP-S
41543,then r2,CP-S
41544,"we cant set our r to 0, so just pick 10",CP-S
41545,so just trial and error and then ill do mine then 3,CP-S
41546,so we just do some proportion stuff then,CP-S
41547,maybe just do v across yours to be the thing you need,CP-S
41548,everyone switch to 450 ohm,CP-S
41549,sdo we add our resistance,CP-S
41550,so everyone go to 1000 ohm,CP-S
41551,increase by one level,CP-S
41552,now just adjust the resistor until you get 4,CP-S
41553,so circut 2 adjust the resistor till you get 4 on the multimeter and then circut 3 adjust till you get 4 on the multimeter i think,CP-S
41554,try a greater resistor,CP-S
41555,okay try the 680,CP-S
41556,play around with it and see if you can get to something close to 4,CP-S
41557,okay now someone else change theirs,CP-S
41558,let's try to find ones below 1k,CP-S
41559,okay lets all go to 680 ohms,CP-S
41560,so we need to go up,CP-S
41561,everyone go up 1 and ill go down one,CP-S
41562,"maybe were too close together? ill go down 4, pliers go up 4",CP-S
41563,let's both go down 1,CP-S
41564,drop it to 100,CP-S
41565,Ok lets try this,CP-S
41566,so maybe yall try 280,CP-S
41567,reduce ur resistors,CP-S
41568,just press anything guys,CP-S
41569,plug the cable back in,CP-S
41570,keep the resister as 560,CP-S
41571,or make it 680,CP-S
41572,register as 680,CP-S
41573,everybody keep the first one,CP-S
41574,okay lets go then,CP-S
41575,now lets try little higher,CP-S
41576,1K is perfect,CP-S
41577,lets use that,CP-S
41578,lets go for 680k ohms,CP-S
41579,"i know, try 100k",CP-S
41580,use 18k,CP-S
41581,DO THAT,CP-S
41582,flip the red and black cable the negative sign will disappear,CP-S
41583,33K FAST,CP-S
41584,GOO,CP-S
41585,i think we should reduce,CP-S
41586,To change the resistance click on the resistor thing,CP-S
41587,"Okay, so we gotta do some math",CP-S
41588,So let's calculate the voltage of R0 real quick,CP-S
41589,Everybody set your resistance to 10,CP-S
41590,Wait no yeah put it on 10,CP-S
41591,Everybody set your resistance to like 100,CP-S
41592,Try 82,CP-S
41593,"Okay, let's try putting it on step higher",CP-S
41594,See how it changes,CP-S
41595,Okay so we gotta take it up even higher,CP-S
41596,Try 220,CP-S
41597,One step higher,CP-S
41598,One step higher I guess,CP-S
41599,"Okay, back to math",CP-S
41600,Good old ohms law,CP-S
41601,ya lets get all our info together,CP-S
41602,Increase the resistance up a notch,CP-S
41603,can we all put it on 120,CP-S
41604,"Idk though, worth a shot",CP-S
41605,Everybody divide your goal by .0080833333333,CP-S
41606,Everyone recheck their math,CP-S
41607,Each resistor affects the others so do we need to coordinate and pick ones at the same time,CP-S
41608,try 560 all,CP-S
41609,just unhook the battery and probe it,CP-S
41610,unhook the green wires and connect the red to the left and the black to the right and that will give you the vale,CP-S
41611,then hook it back up,CP-S
41612,try 154.1,CP-S
41613,double click on it,CP-S
41614,switch red and blue around,CP-S
41615,change ohms to 390,CP-S
41616,calculate it,CP-S
41617,so get a current measurement,CP-S
41618,then solve,CP-S
41619,then divide what ever volts you need by .075,CP-S
41620,go to DCV 20,CP-S
41621,click on 22 ohms for resistor,CP-S
41622,divide your goal by .075,CP-S
41623,so you guys need to change yours,CP-S
41624,ok so you guys go down a bit now,CP-S
41625,go back,CP-S
41626,or up,CP-S
41627,down 1,CP-S
41628,go back,CP-S
41629,ok go,CP-S
41630,up one more everyone,CP-S
41631,just click the green wire and put one of the thingys on it,CP-S
41632,click green wire and put black thing on it,CP-S
41633,imput in the thing below Chat,CP-S
41634,so green move down,CP-S
41635,go back up,CP-S
41636,go up again,CP-S
41637,go again,CP-S
41638,go up again,CP-S
41639,blue go up one,CP-S
41640,ok set your resistors to that,CP-S
41641,everyone do their V=IR. cause V=IR(1) V=IR(2) and V=IR(3),CP-S
41642,everybody change your risistors to 220,CP-S
41643,we'll get close again and then play with it,CP-S
41644,and then each of us will go up 1 and down one.,CP-S
41645,both of you set your resistor to the same ohms its says at the top,CP-S
41646,stop where we are right now and say what you have your resistor set as,CP-S
41647,"Hold up, I'm gonna try to get mine close to it, then the second circuit can go, then the third and we can see if it averages out",CP-S
41648,so the third person should go and see if they can get it back up to 2.25,CP-S
41649,everyone go to 390 if that doesnt work go back to how we are now,CP-S
41650,say before you do partner,CP-S
41651,Someone else try going up one,CP-S
41652,someone try 390 470 and 560,CP-S
41653,Okay try going down another,CP-S
41654,lets all use 1k ohm resistor and we can just trial and error from there,CP-S
41655,hook your wires up and turn your meter one space to the right,CP-S
41656,turn your dials to acv 200 and try and make the number reach 4.0,CP-S
41657,lets try all making them the same,CP-S
41658,start at 220,CP-S
41659,so lets set r1 and r2 the same,CP-S
41660,and have r3 trial it,CP-S
41661,lets go to the next one,CP-S
41662,lets us check well,CP-S
41663,both of you go to 1000,CP-S
41664,we all gotta do 330/3,CP-S
41665,everyone do 100 ohm,CP-S
41666,Lets make circuits 1-3 and equivalent then voltage divide out to find each resistance,CP-S
41667,I think we need to use current to solve this. Mine is 18.6 amps,CP-S
41668,then we can change the resistors to get 2 volts,CP-S
41669,erry one finna try 560,CP-S
41670,alright lets do it,CP-S
41671,Try 39,CP-S
41672,Try 100 everyone,CP-S
41673,we can just guess timate until we get because all our resistances have to be equal,CP-S
41674,Try 330,CP-S
41675,If one person wants to go ahead and do the math and than tell us what to set our resistances to that might work,CP-S
41676,Try r1 = 64,CP-S
41677,so should we total all our voltages and then set that for E,CP-S
41678,everyine set their voltage to 100 ohms,CP-S
41679,try it out,CP-S
41680,"ok, everyone set resistance to 100",CP-S
41681,"try it, no idea if that will work",CP-S
41682,Everybody set your resistance to 100 ohms. Now whats your V?,CP-S
41683,you dont. you change the value of your resistor,CP-S
41684,we have to change the values of our resistors to get to the goal voltage,CP-S
41685,go back to what you originally had,CP-S
41686,we can take all our resistances and do a proportion of the total voltage to find E I think,CP-S
41687,"if you take out one end of the green leads, and connect in series and then switch the meter to measure current",CP-S
41688,dont change your r and everyone tell me your v value,CP-S
41689,put your resistors back for a sec,CP-S
41690,enter in the voltage across the bottom,CP-S
41691,V=IR chop chop,CP-S
41692,alright so I guess we have to find the current through R0 first,CP-S
41693,i think you pull out the first lead from the circuit and connect the meter into that break,CP-S
41694,you have to lift up one end of the wire and one end of the resistor and put the leads between there,CP-S
41695,I think you need to lower the resistance on yours,CP-S
41696,or...we could avoid the math and put all our resistors at the same R and just check the V each time,CP-S
41697,just start guessing every value of E,CP-S
41698,"we should all just start at 100 and see what we get, move on from there",CP-S
41699,so if you need less than that go down,CP-S
41700,E = IR and we can use our measured values of E and our resistance to determine I which is constant throughout and then use that and R0 to get E,CP-S
41701,lets just all start at 120 and go from there again,CP-S
41702,I think wee were supposed to do that first,CP-S
41703,mess around til we get it i guess,CP-S
41704,so we use E and R0 to find R1 R2 and R3,CP-S
41705,everyone hit resistance 270 and see what happens,CP-S
41706,so we need to go up,CP-S
41707,everyone hit 330 because i think thats the next one,CP-S
41708,everyone try 220,CP-S
41709,try 270,CP-S
41710,so we need math,CP-S
41711,everyone try that. Divide your V by .028 and put in the closest value,CP-S
41712,try using I as .0106,CP-S
41713,everyone divide your voltage by .010638 and put whats close.,CP-S
41714,Someone else needs to change their resistance,CP-S
41715,lower,CP-S
41716,someone go a little higher,CP-S
41717,someone needs to dial it down one notch,CP-S
41718,someone go up a resistance level,CP-S
41719,go up,CP-S
41720,someone else go down,CP-S
41721,i'm at 180 someone else has to go up,CP-S
41722,try 220,CP-S
41723,someone try going down a notch,CP-S
41724,try going 330,CP-S
41725,you have to use the meter and its measured in amps,CP-S
41726,put it on the one that says 10A,CP-S
41727,click on the resistance and a drop down menu will show some resistances,CP-S
41728,Try 390,CP-S
41729,we might just have to go through as a group and each choose the same and go through until we get 3,CP-S
41730,just trial and error,CP-S
41731,try 270,CP-S
41732,I think we have to figure out the total R to get the 3 volts and then mix and match until we get the R,CP-S
41733,dial should be set to 20 DC,CP-S
41734,okay let me get to near 2.5 and then you will probably have to go up a few clicks,CP-S
41735,bump yours up again then,CP-S
41736,do what we did before,CP-S
41737,let's try this again,CP-S
41738,someone try going up see if that works,CP-S
41739,You two try changing yours now,CP-S
41740,everyone drop to 10 ohms,CP-S
41741,put in a random number for E,CP-S
41742,Everyone calculate their Voltage first,CP-S
41743,Just put the red probe on the left and the black probe on the right of your resistor,CP-S
41744,That is step 1,CP-S
41745,"Ok, what we do now is subtract all of our Voltage's from E in order to calculate V0",CP-S
41746,just set yalls to 330 and lets play around,CP-S
41747,Somebody go back,CP-S
41748,We all have to set our resistors to different settings to reach each of our goals,CP-S
41749,lets all just set it as low as possible on 10,CP-S
41750,then we can play w it,CP-S
41751,we all have to be on the same resistance and keep building until it reaches the goal,CP-S
41752,everyone set it on 100,CP-S
41753,GO,CP-S
41754,try 330,CP-S
41755,everyone try 390,CP-S
41756,now try 470,CP-S
41757,So everyone just start at 10 again lol,CP-S
41758,so yall wil just have to adjust accordingly,CP-S
41759,both of you guys lower it to 390 and tell me what it reads,CP-S
41760,raise it up a notch,CP-S
41761,We all have different goals this time so the only way i think we will be able to figure this one out is to at least attempt to do the math,CP-S
41762,switch your red and black thingys to get it positive,CP-S
41763,HERES THE PLAN,CP-S
41764,I think the first step is calculating total resistance,CP-S
41765,EVERYONE SET RESISTANCE TO 170,CP-S
41766,"Okay guys, let's try again",CP-S
41767,So do the highest possible divided by 4,CP-S
41768,Everyone just try to play around and make your thing read 170 A,CP-S
41769,Try 3.9,CP-S
41770,Everyone make it 2.7,CP-S
41771,tr 2.2,CP-S
41772,lets do 1,CP-S
41773,Everyone do 1 and see what that gives us,CP-S
41774,Lets do 560,CP-S
41775,Try 680,CP-S
41776,Start high and work our way down,CP-S
41777,"So this time, instead of saying a specific number to try next, say UP or DOWN",CP-S
41778,lets all put our resistance to 150 to being,CP-S
41779,UP,CP-S
41780,up,CP-S
41781,Okay. Lets try 1Kohm,CP-S
41782,"Ok, north lets just run it with us two",CP-S
41783,"Okay, lets do 680",CP-S
41784,UP,CP-S
41785,down,CP-S
41786,try 560,CP-S
41787,hmmmm maybe we need to use.....math);,CP-S
41788,if we add them all up I think we can calculate R0 and then get the current,CP-S
41789,put the red lead on the left side of the resistor and the black lead on the right,CP-S
41790,can you guys change the resistance,CP-S
41791,put all of them at 330,CP-S
41792,put the resistance at 18,CP-S
41793,set it to 82,CP-S
41794,try 47 as the resistance,CP-S
41795,lets just all try 120,CP-S
41796,then well go up in increments,CP-S
41797,go back to 120,CP-S
41798,try that,CP-S
41799,go 180,CP-S
41800,look for 3 numbers that add up to 205 and we can each select one,CP-S
41801,put it to 20,CP-S
41802,okay one of you guys needs to lower your resistance some,CP-S
41803,lets all try 560 ohms,CP-S
41804,lets try that,CP-S
41805,look at my board to see the current voltage,CP-S
41806,we need to find that R first by taking V/I,CP-S
41807,find I by using R0,CP-S
41808,you can find I buy using the multimeter,CP-S
41809,try 12,CP-S
41810,change it to 12 im pretty sure that is our answer but i could be wrong,CP-S
41811,change it to 120 i was off by a multiple of 10,CP-S
41812,i guess just move up to 150 to see if it works,CP-S
41813,red or green lock in a resistor value and let the other fiddle around utnill we get 2.75,CP-S
41814,Something lower,CP-S
41815,Or I guess higher now,CP-S
41816,someone go up like 10 ohms if you can,CP-S
41817,"Someone needs to go down, I'm at 3.2",CP-S
41818,everyone go too 330,CP-S
41819,go back to the same resistance you had,CP-S
41820,take your drop/0.012 and pick the closest resistance to that,CP-S
41821,So one of us just needs to make a slight adjustment...,CP-S
41822,ok then stay the same,CP-S
41823,click on the gray cylinder and change the resistance to 470,CP-S
41824,"right click on your resistor and change the value to 470 ohms, that should be able to do it",CP-S
41825,so multiply your resistance by 0.00599 to see if it matches your goal,CP-S
41826,everyone set yours to 100 ohms,CP-S
41827,then we will all have the same voltage drop across our resistors and can find E,CP-S
41828,Hook up your multimeter to either side of your resistor- it gives the voltage drop across that resistor,CP-S
41829,round up if you have to,CP-S
41830,again divide V by I to get R,CP-S
41831,take it at 330 again for a sec,CP-S
41832,keep stepping it up to increase your voltage,CP-S
41833,"yeah, its voltage. I think if we can guess and check our own voltages to be correct, we can find the current, then calculate what R0's voltage is and then add the voltages together.",CP-S
41834,change it to 220\,CP-S
41835,"680, 270, 560",CP-S
41836,we can tell eachother our current resistor values and voltage drops and we can combine that with R0 to find E,CP-S
41837,Everyone set to 220 ohms so the drop will al be the same and we can just add them,CP-S
41838,do the math first,CP-S
41839,try decreasing each of your values,CP-S
41844,take your goal voltage and divide it by that,CP-S
41845,I need you guys to change resistor values,CP-S
41846,since all of our resistance values affect one another we should have only one person change at a time,CP-S
41847,everyone put in 10 at the bottom and we should be goof to go,CP-S
41848,it is everyone just needs to put in 10 E at the bottom where it says unknown value I believe,CP-S
41849,Put 10V at the bottom,CP-S
41850,rememrebr your resistnace,CP-S
41851,try 33,CP-S
41852,try 47 ohm,CP-S
41853,getting me 1.98 lets all put that and try and click we got it,CP-S
41854,Try 15 ohm,CP-S
41855,everyone try 100 ohm for me right quick,CP-S
41856,try 100k,CP-S
41857,try 330 for me,CP-S
41858,Try 180,CP-S
41859,just spam answers into it,CP-S
41860,whoever doesn't have theirs,CP-S
41861,tinker a bit mine is real close,CP-S
41862,go up one,CP-S
41863,try 270,CP-S
41865,If it's at 7.2 for R0 it means the current is 7.2mA throughout the circuit,CRF-F
41866,so my res is going to be the lowest of the 3,CRF-F
41867,so since paper is lowest they need the highest resistance,CRF-F
41868,given earliers fiddlings ive deduced that we can't go lower than 20 DCV,CRF-F
41869,we just need to use the calcutor if we did.,CRF-F
41870,ok so all resistors shoul dbe 390 ohms,CRF-F
41871,same volatge across each if they are the same.,CRF-F
41872,should give you your R value,CRF-F
41873,i think e=7V,CRF-F
41874,"If they're all 3V, split between 4 resistors, the resistances should all be the same as R0",CRF-F
41875,I think we all have to enter it before we can continue,CRF-F
41876,maybe we all need to be over 1k,CRF-F
41877,maybe because our resistors are so high,CRF-F
41878,I,CRF-F
41879,I think we need a bigger distance between our resistors,CRF-F
41880,"then 14V should be right, because R0 should be 3V.",CRF-F
41881,i think it has to meet what it says your specific goal is,CRF-F
41882,152.95 should be our total resistance,CRF-F
41883,if total resistance is 153,CRF-F
41884,then there would be 30 left,CRF-F
41885,ok so if R = 150 then V = 0.73,CRF-F
41886,if you set yours up right we can click on it and set ours up the same way,CRF-F
41887,because if yours changes the others do,CRF-F
41888,peach should have higher resistor i think,CRF-F
41889,i think we can just make up a e total,CRF-F
41890,and base our values off that,CRF-F
41891,i think I is 0.0162,CRF-F
41892,"ok, so to make 2.5 volts the total resistance should be about 154",CRF-F
41893,"if mine is 39, the other two r's should sum up to 154",CRF-F
41894,im still at 0 for mine at the DVC setting so i think that the ohms on circuit 1 need to be reduced so that i can get a reading,CRF-F
41895,but even if you have 8.2M we should be getting a reading,CRF-F
41896,is everyones wires connected in. I accidentally was not connected before so maybe that is why no readings are coming through,CRF-F
41897,maybe if we have the same one it will work,CRF-F
41898,going to assume we all need .83 again,CRF-F
41899,E=sum of the three circuits. I believe each of the three individual IRs added together.,CRF-F
41900,like i think r is our added resistances but i have no idea what e is,CRF-F
41901,i think its 4,CRF-F
41902,I think the middle cursiut needs to stay at 150,CRF-F
41903,i think the middle should stay at 150 and the two ends move up and dow.  if that made any sense,CRF-F
41904,"if we know v1, v2, and v3, we know what E =, then we can find v0. right, so then how do we find the current I?",CRF-F
41905,because if you subtract the sum of ours voltages from the total (14) you get 1.15,CRF-F
41906,I think that all of us,CRF-F
41907,everyone should be 150,CRF-F
41908,if everyone has the same goal the resistors should be the same,CRF-F
41909,We've gotta some math I think,CRF-F
41910,I guess miss around with the resistor until you get your volts,CRF-F
41911,i think we need to combine all the boards,CRF-F
41912,the sum should be 17,CRF-F
41913,"i think when one of us changes the resistor, it changes the voltage for all of us",CRF-F
41914,i think it's the voltage,CRF-F
41915,if i do mu e=ir then i get 1416 at my e,CRF-F
41916,all 3 should be the same,CRF-F
41917,guessed 10v,CRF-F
41918,so i think our i total is .0047 amps,CRF-F
41919,"all the math adds up if our resistors are 470, 150,390, and 690",CRF-F
41920,i think i should be 120,CRF-F
41921,that divided by the resistance should give curent,CRF-F
41922,so our voltage drops need to add up to 11.13 v,CRF-F
41923,"I think we use that, put it in V=IR. and alter our R accordingly",CRF-F
41924,"all the voltages have to add together. if the voltage thru our 3 resis is 2.25, then 2.25V has to go thru R0",CRF-F
41925,so I think the resistance is supposed to be 220 for all the resistors,CRF-F
41926,so i think the best choice would be 180,CRF-F
41927,try 1k if you need .78 and try 330 if you need 2.56,CRF-F
41928,"look here bucko, im set to DCV 20, if thats not volts than im not sure what is",CRF-F
41929,Because if we know I and we know each V then we can find Vtot,CRF-F
41930,If we go one by one starting with circuit one it should help,CRF-F
41931,"Like if they get theirs, then I get mine, then circuit 3 goes",CRF-F
41932,"I should have highest R in group, thats all ive got at this point",CRF-F
41933,So Circuit one should be able to increase now,CRF-F
41934,i think we find the current by setting out resistors to a number,CRF-F
41935,"i think because 2.5 is one quarter the total V and each resistor being the same resistance, since there are 4, makes it even",CRF-F
41936,i think we calculate the current based on that,CRF-F
41937,and then devide our voltage by the curent to find our resistor,CRF-F
41938,...we should all have the same voltage right now,CRF-F
41939,then we can calculate the battery voltage based on total resistance,CRF-F
41940,if you break it between the green wire and the resistor and put the probes in between,CRF-F
41941,if we add R0 R1 R2 and R3 we know the battery voltage so we can solve for I,CRF-F
41942,Wont that current just change though if we change the resistance,CRF-F
41943,that value would equal the voltage in R0,CRF-F
41944,Well if we kirchoff the loop our drops will all equal the battery,CRF-F
41945,if we add up our resistances with R0 and multiple by I we have V,CRF-F
41946,with target values it will be 0.005,CRF-F
41947,if we solve for r0 first we can find e easy,CRF-F
41948,"Oh, if you click on it it changes, got it",CRF-F
41949,i think our r will be the same,CRF-F
41950,i think the units may be off,CRF-F
41951,So mine is last so it won't change,CRF-F
41952,and then use that i for the whole shabang,CRF-F
41953,i think it should be each of us at 150 ohms,CRF-F
41954,i think we can measure the AMP,CRF-F
41955,then we can find v0,CRF-F
41956,i think the battery is 13V tho cause if you just measure with the green wire with 1 up you get 13V,CRF-F
41957,"wait green, why cant you change resistance? if i click on my resistor i can change its resistance",CRF-F
41958,i think something might be wrong with yours cause i dont think it shold be locked,CRF-F
41959,"so I measured 4.07V and if the current is 0.009, my R1=452Ohm",CRF-F
41960,i think we still have to get to the correct voltage of each resistor,CRF-F
41961,current would have to be 0.0159 for green to have 820,CRF-F
41962,"Okay, so that means we should end up with the same resistor value.",CRF-F
41963,I think my resistor value is about 120 ohms.,CRF-F
41964,I think mine is about 1k,CRF-F
41965,"Alright. If we all set our resistors to 270 ohms, we should all get 1.5V.",CRF-F
41966,"if we have 2 circuit that equal the same amount, that will divide the voltage in half",CRF-F
41967,i think each one have our own circuit,CRF-F
41968,I think we need to use the V = I*R but idk for sure,CRF-F
41969,the unkown voltage i thought would be 5.94,CRF-F
41970,total resistance is gonna be all those combined,CRF-F
41971,im close but no quite there. My resistor is around 82 and lions should be 560 and tiger 220ish,CRF-F
41972,"ok total resistance should be equal to 1100, if r0 is equal to 20% of the voltage drop",CRF-F
41973,It is probably 12V,CRF-F
41974,"if we all set our resistance to 270, the total voltage will be equal to one of ours * 4",CRF-F
41975,ok total voltage should be 13,CRF-F
41976,"Okay, the higher I go the more voltage I get. Hey guitar, try increasing yours.",CRF-F
41977,if me and piano set ours to  8.2M ohms its basically like nothing is there so horn can just set his to what ever we need it to so we get 4.25v,CRF-F
41978,When I change it to 4.7m I get 4.54.,CRF-F
41979,So if you take 8 and divide it by 330 you get 0.024 amps right,CRF-F
41980,i think we just need to find a common resistor for each of the 3 places but im not entirely sure how to get there,CRF-F
41981,all of them i think,CRF-F
41982,I think by resistor has to be between 1K 1.5K.,CRF-F
41983,im pretty sure if we set our resistances equal to R0 we will all have a 2.5 V drop,CRF-F
41984,"so if each resistor has 2.5, they all add to 10",CRF-F
41985,"if you are measuring current, i think in this case you have to use the 10A setting",CRF-F
41986,Now if we take 0.00965 * R0 (which is 100) we will get the voltage drop across R0,CRF-F
41987,"if lion meets the voltage goal then i can do mine, since im 2nd in line",CRF-F
41988,"Because we are all in order, if we solve our resistor in a sequential order, that should work",CRF-F
41989,"well lets start from the beginning, If I do 1.43 (target)/.0275(A) then I get 52??",CRF-F
41990,"Well 3.14+6.71+1.43=11.28V, then 13-11.28 should be 1.72V for R0",CRF-F
41991,I is going to be the same for all of them so it should just be 2.25/680,CRF-F
41992,Im assuming V=I/R,CRF-F
41993,If currents the same acrossed all the resistors cant we just measure it with the multimeter,CRF-F
41994,the v should be 17.009259,CRF-F
41995,should be,CRF-F
41996,i think we need 2358.5 ohms,CRF-F
41997,I think v is 10.37,CRF-F
41998,that what we were trying earlier. we should be able to calculate R0's v because amps should be the same throughout the circuit,CRF-F
41999,"Since we all need equal voltage and the first resistor also needs 3.5V, I believe we need the same resistance as R0",CRF-F
42000,"If i set my resistor to 560 ohms I have 6.9 volts and if its set to 680 ohms, it is at 7.32 volts. my goal is 7.23",CRF-F
42001,they should all be the same I think,CRF-F
42002,"if we add ours together, the voltage drop over the first resistor is 11.47V",CRF-F
42003,so the current through our circuit should be about 20mA,CRF-F
42004,voltage over R0 should be 4.56,CRF-F
42005,current should be .0081428A,CRF-F
42006,"well if they are all have the same resistance drop then they shold be the same resistance, what are you ona?",CRF-F
42007,i think we gotta do this mathematically....,CRF-F
42008,guess its milliamps,CRF-F
42009,current should all be the same,CRF-F
42010,so 17.6 should hold true for everyone,CRF-F
42011,I think that means everything should have the same resistance,CRF-F
42012,That means the current should be 4.87 /  270,CRF-F
42013,Should be 4.91,CRF-F
42014,"Okay, then the current should be 4.91 / 270",CRF-F
42015,"So if you divide your target voltage by that value for current, you should get your resistance",CRF-F
42016,I got that mine should be about 180,CRF-F
42017,If we just use the defaults then we can find the voltages for each of us and the current for the circuit,CRF-F
42018,I think it should be 17 V,CRF-F
42019,If you break the path and then measure the voltage across the break it returns 17,CRF-F
42020,Each resistor should be 220 ohms I guess,CRF-F
42021,mine should be 220,CRF-F
42022,pot should be 470,CRF-F
42023,pan should be 390,CRF-F
42024,the current should be the same idk why its different,CRF-F
42025,okay explained how to use what we learned last class as a strategy to find the two unknowns,CRF-F
42026,if thats the current i think the resistance for r0 would be 1k,CRF-F
42027,Thats the very first resistance that is already given I think,CRF-F
42028,I think you have to do E=I/R to find I,CRF-F
42029,so together thats 9.26V but i think we have to add the voltage from R0 also,CRF-F
42030,if thats what we are supposed to do I got 15.55 but you might need to change yours to 1K too first,CRF-F
42031,should be 17.94,CRF-F
42032,if you lot can get close then let me know,CRF-F
42033,"if then, we have 4.032",CRF-F
42034,i think we have to change our resistors too,CRF-F
42035,if everyone divided their goal voltage by .008,CRF-F
42036,it should be your resistor value,CRF-F
42037,If that's the case E should be 15.86V,CRF-F
42038,"Cause we can't find I unless we have E, but we don't know E",CRF-F
42039,Well if V=IxR We can use I=V/R by adding all the voltage and resistances together and using I=V/R maybe?,CRF-F
42040,I think it's our best shot right now. I have no idea how else we would calculate it,CRF-F
42041,"everything should be the same value, so if that's true we can plug that in for IxR0",CRF-F
42042,If I put it down one then i am under,CRF-F
42043,i think it represents a resistance thats already on there,CRF-F
42044,im using a pretty high resistor so if i decrease it or increase it its gonna jump pretty low/high,CRF-F
42045,if i go up we jump to 5v,CRF-F
42046,I think E is 8.14 volts,CRF-F
42047,So R1 should have the bigger resistance,CRF-F
42048,if i go to 390 i get 4.77,CRF-F
42049,i believe the sum should be 1000,CRF-F
42050,so if we add up ours and subtract it from the total voltage,CRF-F
42051,we can get the voltage of r0,CRF-F
42052,ok so i think we have to do it one a a time,CRF-F
42053,if we all have the same voltage we should have the same resistance,CRF-F
42054,we have to add all of them up,CRF-F
42055,and that should be Rt,CRF-F
42056,so if everyone is at 820 resistance the Rt should be 3280,CRF-F
42057,so if we start with 1k r,CRF-F
42058,so then we can do what we did last time to find r0 volts,CRF-F
42059,i think  thats supposed to be r0 resistance,CRF-F
42060,so our current is 3.86 mili amps i think,CRF-F
42061,maybe cuz were all trying to get a reading at the same time,CRF-F
42062,our Resistors prob have to be diff,CRF-F
42063,well it would have to be total resistance,CRF-F
42064,it will change every time i change resistance,CRF-F
42065,i think we need share voltage now then plus them together,CRF-F
42066,so in theory it should be the sum of all our targets,CRF-F
42067,if we change all of resistor to150,CRF-F
42068,thats gonna be 4 150 resistors,CRF-F
42069,well we should have the same,CRF-F
42070,"Huh, I think it changes as we all add on our changes",CRF-F
42071,should be 220 for you i think,CRF-F
42072,it should be same across all those,CRF-F
42073,"well according to my current and del V, I should be a 355.799 ohm",CRF-F
42074,so if we have 6 ma witrh 4k ohm resistance,CRF-F
42075,should be the 68ohm one,CRF-F
42076,24 volts was if we used that 4k ohm load,CRF-F
42077,so if we inch our way up by adding R,CRF-F
42078,maybe we get to our desired V total with the wrong ohms,CRF-F
42079,we can find the total resistance we have to reach,CRF-F
42080,so if i up mine it should reach 4.52,CRF-F
42081,then we know the total resistance between our 3 resistors,CRF-F
42082,i think we are supposed to figure out how to get 4.5 volts overall cause all of our circuts are connected,CRF-F
42083,if anyone changes anything,CRF-F
42084,it changes everyones values,CRF-F
42085,"it should by like 560,680 or 820",CRF-F
42086,"so if R = 10 for all of ours, the Req = 420",CRF-F
42087,Well if we all change ours that's gonna change,CRF-F
42088,okay one value might be off then,CRF-F
42089,that should work,CRF-F
42090,it should be 9/120,CRF-F
42091,i think if we all go up one it should be closer,CRF-F
42092,that shouldnt be true,CRF-F
42093,ok so if red goes up then me and green go down in volts,CRF-F
42094,"you guys might need to go above yours, and I might need to bring you down]",CRF-F
42095,i think im 2 so i go second hawk are you 3,CRF-F
42096,So on 470 it's 2.15 but on the next one up it's like way too high,CRF-F
42097,4 came up when we had different ones so maybe two should be the same and another can change it up as a trial,CRF-F
42098,if Req 150+r1+r2+r3 and i is 8/150+r1+r2+r3 then its just going to give us 8 for v when you use v=iReq,CRF-F
42099,this one should work,CRF-F
42100,I think if everybody changes their resistance to 820 ohms we would all have 3.75 V,CRF-F
42101,bc if it does then we need a total of only 386,CRF-F
42102,All of the currents should be the same,CRF-F
42103,oh maybe someone has a break in their circuit so that's changing everybody elses to 0,CRF-F
42104,It might be R1,CRF-F
42105,so you should just be able to do goal = (your resistance/ 1.98 kohms) * 13 to find your resistanc,CRF-F
42106,mine should be at 360 ohms,CRF-F
42107,mine should be around 290,CRF-F
42108,Should be 7.15,CRF-F
42109,i think if we put all of ours to 680 we will get 2.5,CRF-F
42110,I think were gonna have to have different resistances,CRF-F
42111,yeah if we have to same resistance we'll have the same voltage,CRF-F
42112,there has to be a math way to fo this,CRF-F
42113,"we just enter one i think, like our voltages right now equal 13.06, so if we choose E to be 14, then r0's voltage would be .94",CRF-F
42114,so I think since the current is the same throughout then if we have the same resistance the voltage would be the same,CRF-F
42115,i think we might have different once,CRF-F
42116,think this might be it,CRF-F
42117,it should be IxR,CRF-F
42118,the relationship between I and R should be the same for all of them,CRF-F
42119,Maybe if all 3 of our resistances add up to 470 it will work,CRF-F
42120,I think once hawk changes we might be good,CRF-F
42121,Maybe it needs E,CRF-F
42122,Upping your resistance decreases your voltage.,CRF-F
42123,I think,CRF-F
42124,I think when you guys change yours it changes on our screens as well,CRF-F
42125,I think messing with the green wires is how we change the voltages,CRF-F
42126,We want our current to be 170,CRF-F
42127,new theory^,CRF-F
42128,Haha dont think our strategy will work from last time,CRF-F
42129,so i think that the setting on the meter should be 20 then,CRF-F
42130,im the first circuit so I think my resistor needs to be the smallest,CRF-F
42131,"if we solve ohms law, the resistance should be 60 if we want the voltage across the resistor to be 4.5",CRF-F
42132,I think it changes based on what each other puts,CRF-F
42133,btw the goal is to get all resistors correct. we all have a different resistor in the circuit.,CRF-F
42134,"so red will have the highest resistance, ill have the medium most and green should have the smallest resitor",CRF-F
42135,"which means I= 0.00957... amps, and we each need ~470 volts on our resistor i think",CRF-F
42136,if you make your resistance higher it will take up more volts,CRF-F
42137,okay so if 1.45=120*I,CRF-F
42138,the current is 0.012083,CRF-F
42139,"If I got to 82 ohms, I'm at .65, if I go to 100 ohms, I'm .78. I need .69",CRF-F
42140,i think it is becasue we are all changing our resistors at the same time,CRF-F
42141,I think it works it we all keep clicking stuff till we get the right answers,CRF-F
42142,"Interesting, the beginning question is the same as the tutorial",CRF-R
42143,well we have 4 R,CRF-R
42144,ok so we know the total current,CRF-R
42145,and the voltage across 3 of the resistors,CRF-R
42146,however we don't know Rt,CRF-R
42147,This time the answer require diffent volts on each resistor,CRF-R
42148,E is unknow,CRF-R
42149,damn its different now,CRF-R
42150,and there's a fourth resistor that we know nothing about,CRF-R
42151,all of our circuits are linked together,CRF-R
42152,Are your leads connected to the resistor? All of our resistors are connected to the same curcuit,CRF-R
42153,each of us have a resistor,CRF-R
42154,"So the circuit starts off at 13 Volts, an original resistor that we have no control over is at 150 Ohms",CRF-R
42155,so same question,CRF-R
42156,ok so its all the same,CRF-R
42157,"okay, so i think we are all supposed to combine our boards, beacuse ini the picture at the bottom it has circut one, circut two, circut three and thats like each of us",CRF-R
42158,this ones a guessing game,CRF-R
42159,it should be the same,CRF-R
42160,each same resistance same voltage drop,CRF-R
42161,ours need to be about double the next,CRF-R
42162,then we can increase,CRF-R
42163,ok so then its like last time. v=ir to get our resistances based on our goal voltages,CRF-R
42164,adding the voltages is like doing a kirchoff,CRF-R
42165,ya cuz the circuit is still the same as the last time. resistors in series.,CRF-R
42166,oh wait no i meant like we should all get the same current in this problem. not the same current as the last problem,CRF-R
42167,How can it be different we're in series,CRF-R
42168,Current should be the same in series. Game obviously broken,CRF-R
42169,All of our resistors added up give R0,CRF-R
42170,"the current is just a constant tho, right? since we are in series",CRF-R
42171,The current changes when the resistance in other circuits are changed,CRF-R
42172,Got it this one is harder,CRF-R
42173,All voltage drops need to add up to source voltage.,CRF-R
42174,Well if we each need a 3.5v drop then R0 needs to have a voltage drop of 3.5v,CRF-R
42175,It is a series circuit. Have to use total resistance.,CRF-R
42176,everyone's is different,CRF-R
42177,they are all linked remember,CRF-R
42178,okay then the voltage across r0,CRF-R
42179,we should all have the same current,CRF-R
42180,That's because each of our circuits affects the others. So when one changes they all change.,CRF-R
42181,The current is the same acrossed all the resistors when theyre in series,CRF-R
42182,so the same for all 3. easy start,CRF-R
42183,everyone has one resistor from the circuit.,CRF-R
42184,ok we the same there,CRF-R
42185,all the voltages were the same so the resistances would be as well,CRF-R
42186,So all resistors have to be the same value,CRF-R
42187,alright same stuff this time,CRF-R
42188,"I think we all have the same one, we just submit them individually",CRF-R
42189,well it would say complete,CRF-R
42190,"in series, current is same in every place in curcuit",CRF-R
42191,there's gotta be a way we can calculate this,CRF-R
42192,the current should be the same throughout the whole circuit,CRF-R
42193,Well anytime you guys change yours all of them change,CRF-R
42194,wait so it seems all of our resistors go hand in hand if that makes sense,CRF-R
42195,on thing that we do know is that our current will remain the same,CRF-R
42196,alright so same thing,CRF-R
42197,For now it seems to the same,CRF-R
42198,so now we don;t know E...,CRF-R
42199,no R0 too now,CRF-R
42200,"we each have a part, we're in series",CRF-R
42201,so i think we all have different voltages,CRF-R
42202,everyone needs a different resistance and you're trying to find what the resistance across your resistor is so put the red thing on the wire and the black thing on the right side of the resistor,CRF-R
42203,"when triangle changes anything, it changes mine and then changes circle",CRF-R
42204,okay so now we have different goals,CRF-R
42205,so this is a ratio,CRF-R
42206,we each have to find a resistance so that eac of our voltage is 4.5,CRF-R
42207,so this time we have to have different resistance,CRF-R
42208,"Okay, so we're still in series, so we're all gonna have the same current",CRF-R
42209,so now E is 11 and r0 is 100 and we all need different volts,CRF-R
42210,We each have to change our resistance so that all of us meet the voltage goal at the top,CRF-R
42211,so we've all got to have the same thing,CRF-R
42212,we have to all work together to meet our voltage goals,CRF-R
42213,I am circuit one. I think they want us to change the resistance until we get it right.,CRF-R
42214,bc we all have the same goal voltage,CRF-R
42215,its the same problem,CRF-R
42216,we dont know R0 so its a little more difficult,CRF-R
42217,Ok so our resistance will all be the same,CRF-R
42218,so everyone is going to have close to the same values,CRF-R
42219,it should be the same scenario,CRF-R
42220,we are all connected in series.,CRF-R
42221,same,SESU-A
42222,same here,SESU-A
42223,OK now things are interesting,SESU-A
42224,OK,SESU-A
42225,interesting,SESU-A
42226,like moving the decimal forward or back,SESU-A
42227,Ah,SESU-A
42228,ok,SESU-A
42229,ok,SESU-A
42230,oh,SESU-A
42231,ok,SESU-A
42232,ok,SESU-A
42233,thats fine,SESU-A

42739,that makes sense,SESU-A
42740,ok,SESU-A
42741,your,SESU-A
42742,me too,SESU-A
42743,for voltage,SESU-A
42744,or should be,SESU-A
42745,that's our I,SESU-A
42746,for mine,SESU-A
42747,mine as well,SESU-A
42748,now*,SESU-A
42749,ok.,SESU-A
42750,on*,SESU-A
42751,me too,SESU-A
42752,same,SESU-A
42753,me too...,SESU-A
42754,Same...,SESU-A
42755,Exactley!,SESU-A
42756,gotcha.,SESU-A
42757,same,SESU-A
42758,Sounds good,SESU-A
42759,to get the voltage drop for R0,SESU-A
42760,which will be the circuits current,SESU-A
42761,Same as mine.,SESU-A
42762,same,SESU-A
42763,me too,SESU-A
42764,mine too,SESU-A
42765,using multimeter,SESU-A
42766,same,SESU-A
42767,umm,SESU-A
42768,ok,SESU-A
42769,resistor,SESU-A
42770,oh ok,SESU-A
42771,Okay.,SESU-A
42772,ok,SESU-A
42773,ok so,SESU-A
42774,ok,SESU-A
42775,Weird,SESU-A
42776,ok,SESU-A
42777,anyway,SESU-A
42778,alright,SESU-A
42779,just using it for math...,SESU-A
42780,Okay,SESU-A
42781,so you shouldn't have to copy and paste,SESU-A
42782,about,SESU-A
42783,"Oh wait,  I meant E",SESU-A
42784,not R0...,SESU-A
42785,that makes more sense...,SESU-A
42786,So like pull a wire out,SESU-A
42787,Since its all connected,SESU-A
42788,ok,SESU-A
42789,that's what mine reads,SESU-A
42790,to be more exact,SESU-A
42791,circuit,SESU-A
42792,oh,SESU-A
42793,There we go,SESU-A
42794,alright I do too,SESU-A
42795,*now,SESU-A
42796,awesome,SESU-A

43395,I think the voltage is different tho?,SESU-P
43396,no?,SESU-P
43397,lets add them up see what we are missing?,SESU-P
43398,"Let's all say what our DCV is at, it will make our lives easier",SESU-P
43399,May I pitch my idea?,SESU-P
43400,"ok so we Know I need the highest voltage, Pencil need the medium and paper has the lowest voltage required correct?",SESU-P
43401,what if I lowered my DVC to 2000m?,SESU-P
43402,I think the DCV just changes the scale correct?,SESU-P
43403,I am currently reading 3.58 volts did we all do the  V/I,SESU-P
43404,call out answers so we can see whats wrong,SESU-P
43405,ok are you close to your Voltage at least,SESU-P
43406,did you adjust it?,SESU-P
43407,where do you think you're messing up?,SESU-P
43408,Do you know what your resistance is supposed to be,SESU-P
43409,and earlier you said I was 7.2 yeah?,SESU-P
43410,Its fine but Pen is your r set now? i think we should just submit the answers,SESU-P
43411,So is this the same circuit,SESU-P
43412,What is that value for,SESU-P
43413,hey guy how we gonna start this problem?,SESU-P
43414,how about using the figures given to find the current?,SESU-P
43415,can we measure the current on the circuit?,SESU-P
43416,what about you Utah?,SESU-P
43417,what is it?,SESU-P
43418,CONCORD HOW ARE THINGS GOING.I AM TOLD TO MAKE MY VOLTAGE  1.5 VOLTS. HAVE YOU DONE THAT ALREADY,SESU-P
43419,HOW DO I CHANGE THE RESISTER VALUE ON THE MULTIMETER,SESU-P
43420,@?,SESU-P
43421,What are your goal voltages? Mine is 4.25,SESU-P
43422,Looks like we should each have a 120 ohm resistor? I think?,SESU-P
43423,what are your current voltage and resistance readings?,SESU-P
43424,did you all enter your E value on the bottom?,SESU-P
43425,maybe set all R values to 100?,SESU-P
43426,so we ar eall reading 1.46v?,SESU-P
43427,are our resistors still set to 100?,SESU-P
43428,what if we choose a really big resistor,SESU-P
43429,wouldnt it take all the voltage?,SESU-P
43430,so what voltage values does everyone need,SESU-P
43431,We are putting our volts for the unknown right,SESU-P
43432,Cant you just use Rtotal*Current,SESU-P
43433,you have .0127A for the current right?,SESU-P
43434,So add all resistors and multiply by current to get V0?,SESU-P
43435,18V?,SESU-P
43436,Maybe we need to be up higher?,SESU-P
43437,1V high or low,SESU-P
43438,what is it?,SESU-P
43439,"Okay, circuit two has to have a relatively low resistance for the voltage over circuit 3 to be higher, right?",SESU-P
43440,should we just keep adjusting until someone gets it?,SESU-P
43441,"what if everyone sets there resistor to, let's say, 1k Ohms",SESU-P
43442,but won't that change if we change our resistances?,SESU-P
43443,I got 14V for total V. did anyone else find it.,SESU-P

43451,what did you get for E and R0,SESU-P
43452,"can we just make R0 equal zero, making E=8.34?",SESU-P
43453,what is R0?,SESU-P
43454,okay wait soooo our total voltage should be 2.75?,SESU-P

43469,any other ideas,SESU-P
43470,mashed are you at 10 ohms,SESU-P
43471,wait how did u calc total resistance,SESU-P

43941,is everyone at 100ohms right now?,SESU-P
43942,any ideas?,SESU-P
43943,does this mean i have to get out a pen and paper,SESU-P
43944,which resistance then?,SESU-P
43945,who's NOT at 100 ohms?,SESU-P
43946,"I need 1.27 V, what do you guys need?",SESU-P
43947,so E is 9 should we say? or 8.99,SESU-P

43972,v0?,SESU-P
43973,does that work?,SESU-P
43974,I think?,SESU-P
43975,so whats everyones starting values?,SESU-P
43976,anyone else?,SESU-P
43977,so something is wrong with the equations we made maybe?,SESU-P
43978,r0 is 20?????,SESU-P
43979,.086A???,SESU-P
43980,Anyone figure out how to do this?,SESU-P
43981,so should our r all be the same?,SESU-P
43982,"So, are we controlling the amperage?",SESU-P
43983,resistance change?,SESU-P
43984,what did you all set your resistances too? Or does it matter?,SESU-P
43985,is yalls the same?,SESU-P
43986,because that is current right?,SESU-P
43987,So How do you calculate voltage drop again?,SESU-P
43988,Would it be V1=V0*r?,SESU-P
43989,So maye =vo/r?,SESU-P
43990,are you guys trying to figure out voltage  drop?,SESU-P
43991,It should be. So do we need to adjust our resistors to add up to 680?,SESU-P
43992,Becuase our voltages can be the same right?,SESU-P
43993,Also isn't te resitstnace proprtional to the current going through it?,SESU-P
43994,So .000022?,SESU-P
43995,did someone change their resistance?,SESU-P
43996,It is??,SESU-P
43997,ie the original R value which I think was 6.8Kohms?,SESU-P
43998,"Ok, so see how there are two wires coming in?",SESU-P
43999,Go on?,SESU-P
44000,"since current is the same, cant we just calculate the current across r0",SESU-P
44001,i chose 180?,SESU-P
44002,"Then Tiger, give me your ams coming in",SESU-P
44003,I'm sorry to be forgetting things. How do I find that?,SESU-P
44004,is it across the resistor?,SESU-P
44005,14.42?,SESU-P
44006,So R=0.0153?,SESU-P
44007,Set it to DCV 20?,SESU-P
44008,"Bear, any thoughts?",SESU-P
44009,"Alright, wanna try it?",SESU-P
44010,Wanna check> We have 3 minutes,SESU-P
44011,"so just to be clear here, the 1 resistor we see is R0?",SESU-P
44012,My goal is still 4.5 V.  Is yall's still the same,SESU-P
44013,"Hey, So what is everyone's goals",SESU-P
44014,"What are yall setting your r1, 2, and 3 to?",SESU-P

44043,you should see your breadboard with a resistor in it?,SESU-P
44044,do you see that?,SESU-P
44045,so what to we need to do to make our voltage 3.5 V?,SESU-P
44046,is yalls current the same?,SESU-P
44047,Did someone change somethin? My resistor is now 180 ohms,SESU-P
44048,and I no longer have a voltage drop?,SESU-P
44049,Did you break your circuit to measure amps?,SESU-P
44050,"Lol. Lake, What is the resistance of r2?",SESU-P
44051,So you changed it to 180?,SESU-P
44052,is the 3.5v goal to make our 3 resistors add up to a 3.5 v drop?,SESU-P
44053,So are we supposed to make our voltage drops 3.5 or are we supposed to change the source voltage?,SESU-P
44054,id love to do it but im unclear what the 3.5v goal means?,SESU-P
44055,"ok sound good. Real quick, every one list what their restors are at",SESU-P
44056,right?,SESU-P
44057,so we all need to change our resistor value to 560 ohm?,SESU-P
44058,if all resistors are the same value they will all drop the same volts right?,SESU-P
44059,What is everyone's goal voltage?,SESU-P
44060,What is everyone's goal voltage? Mine is 3.35 volts.,SESU-P
44061,is that right?,SESU-P
44062,what we do now?,SESU-P
44063,So for current we can take 5.98/1000?,SESU-P
44064,So 14/1000?,SESU-P
44065,so what are suppose to do now?,SESU-P
44066,what are your guys ohm values,SESU-P
44067,is your v value 4.25,SESU-P
44068,is everyone's goal .9,SESU-P
44069,aren't we just suppose to type in our given ohm value?,SESU-P
44070,what does you R0 equal,SESU-P
44071,bear what is your goal,SESU-P
44072,volts?,SESU-P
44073,what resistor do you have,SESU-P
44074,click on the resistor and what value do you see,SESU-P
44075,what ohm value do you see at the top,SESU-P
44076,Not entirely sure what to do after the resistor is set though?,SESU-P
44077,Ok what are we doing on this one?,SESU-P
44078,"so, how are we getting it to 5.18?",SESU-P
44079,is that E?,SESU-P
44080,do we add them?,SESU-P
44081,everyone write down whatever resistance they have right now to remeber it,SESU-P
44082,now what,SESU-P
44083,whats everyones voltage supposed to be?,SESU-P
44084,so what should we do,SESU-P
44085,Your volts reads 3.75?,SESU-P
44086,do we click next now?,SESU-P
44087,is that good for everyone?,SESU-P
44088,what resistor you got?,SESU-P
44089,what is everyones resistance?,SESU-P
44090,Soooo what do we do now?,SESU-P
44091,who wants to calculate that voltage?,SESU-P
44092,is everyone at their needed voltage?,SESU-P
44093,How exactly would you go about doing that,SESU-P
44094,The resistor?,SESU-P
44095,set yours to random values,SESU-P
44096,what volts does it ask you for?,SESU-P
44097,so  R0 is our total resistance right?,SESU-P
44098,so we know R/Rt must equal 1/4. so how do we coordinate this? do we just pick a random Rt and figure out the R from there?,SESU-P
44099,so maybe they are all 820?,SESU-P
44100,what is everyones voltage required?,SESU-P
44101,i kept mine the same since mine is small and isnt affecting much but are you guys closer?,SESU-P
44102,What is everyone's resistor value and current voltage value,SESU-P
44103,"alrighty, what's the plan?",SESU-P
44104,what are your resistors values?,SESU-P
44105,What is your goal?,SESU-P
44106,How does it look now?,SESU-P
44107,Who has circuit 2?,SESU-P
44108,volt?,SESU-P
44109,What are ya'll getting?,SESU-P
44110,Now?,SESU-P
44111,what resistor values are you at?,SESU-P
44112,Any ideas?,SESU-P
44113,green what your resistor value,SESU-P
44114,Do you mean Blue?,SESU-P
44115,what are yours volts at? both of you,SESU-P
44116,"ok. what are the values now? green and blue. mine are, 270 ohms and 3.74 v",SESU-P
44117,What resistance are you using?,SESU-P
44118,Now?,SESU-P
44119,what is your voltage goal spaniel,SESU-P
44120,howd that change it?,SESU-P
44121,now what is yours at?,SESU-P
44122,"collie, what is your voltage goal again?",SESU-P
44123,have we ever seen anything to be 11V at the source?,SESU-P
44124,what about you collie?,SESU-P
44125,what values do we not know?,SESU-P
44126,ohms or volts?,SESU-P
44127,Ready?,SESU-P
44128,what do we set to,SESU-P
44129,Are we allowed to change the values on the resistor?,SESU-P
44130,"Okay, what color have you selected for your resistor?",SESU-P
44131,Horn? What's your resistor at?,SESU-P
44132,horn whats your Volts now,SESU-P
44133,i wonder if that close enough??,SESU-P
44134,Do you get a pop-up message?,SESU-P
44135,anyone know the equation?,SESU-P
44136,"Guitar, is yours still at 8.3m ohms?",SESU-P
44137,Do you want me to change mine?,SESU-P
44138,whats your guys goal? do we all have the same one?,SESU-P
44139,"Okay, Current resistor numbers.",SESU-P
44140,How do we adjust the resistors,SESU-P
44141,is our meters reading all three of our different resistors?,SESU-P
44142,is yours 2.07 now?,SESU-P
44143,if we all need a volt drop of 2 volts wont all resistors be the same?,SESU-P
44144,Correct me if Im wrong Im just speculating. Resistor 0 drops the voltage .024 so between us 3 we do drop it 1.976 more???,SESU-P
44145,how do we convert the .658 to resistance,SESU-P
44146,doesn't the voltage drop to 0 at the end of the circuit,SESU-P
44147,i think the 0.024 is the current not the voltage drop i think voltage drop for R0 is 0.08 because if you take 0.024 as current and 330 for the resistance and multiply them you get 7.92 and subtract the original voltage 8 a difference of 0.08 so wouldnt that be the volt drop???,SESU-P
44148,Maybe 2 of us do 100 and one does 120?? I'm not sure.,SESU-P
44149,Iowa and I will set to 100 and Ohio do you want to test resistors about 100?,SESU-P
44150,are you still at 2,SESU-P
44151,Would it be just R3 that gets the right reading??,SESU-P
44152,Or will all of ours say 2,SESU-P
44153,"whats everyone on right now, im at 1.91 with a 220 ohm",SESU-P
44154,Do you want to try 220 utah?,SESU-P
44155,so 12.3 mA * 50.6 ohms?,SESU-P
44156,622.38?,SESU-P
44157,"Is that just for wrench, or all of them?",SESU-P
44158,All of our voltages added up is 4.04 volts...?,SESU-P
44159,"so do we need total resistance values added together, multiplied by total current values?",SESU-P
44160,14 v?,SESU-P
44161,what is everyones resistor at,SESU-P
44162,Are your guys' meters reading 0?,SESU-P
44163,"I don't think so, because we need to have a 2.5 volt drop for every resistor. not just 2.5 total....right?",SESU-P
44164,so do we hit \,SESU-P
44165,how about now?,SESU-P
44166,do you guys also want to measure current to confrim what I found?,SESU-P
44167,current should be .11 amps?,SESU-P
44168,which setting on the multimeter did you use,SESU-P
44169,uh lion can you measure yours?,SESU-P
44170,what?,SESU-P
44171,do we know the current?,SESU-P
44172,.0068 is the current through R0?,SESU-P
44173,whats ur voltage right now so i can double check,SESU-P
44174,okay so use .11 for the current?,SESU-P
44175,all ouf our voltages add up to 11 right?,SESU-P
44176,how did you find that?,SESU-P
44177,you said your voltage is 5.64 and .83 and mine is 3.85 so couldnt we just add all of those up and subtract from 11,SESU-P
44178,so .965 volts dropped so 11-that will be where my voltage is at?,SESU-P
44179,ok so that means us 3 are working with 10.035 right?,SESU-P
44180,so what should I do so I can give the next person my voltage drop,SESU-P
44181,how many volts do you need to drop again?,SESU-P
44182,so 3.85/.00965?,SESU-P
44183,"ok , so how about each of us get our voltages one at a time?",SESU-P
44184,so doing that you are finding voltage over R0 right?,SESU-P
44185,ok so current for everyone is .0068 then?,SESU-P
44186,"but when one of us changes our resistance to get our voltage drop, that current will change from .0068 right?",SESU-P
44187,so 11v/100 ohm= .11amps then .11 amps * 11volts to get volt drop right? which would be 1.21 volts .... so 11v-1.21v =9.79volts after r0... so from 9.79volts to lions goal voltage,SESU-P
44188,so lions meter is reading 4.42 volts right?,SESU-P
44189,why did you do .11amp times 11V,SESU-P
44190,wouldnt you divide?,SESU-P
44191,what is the unicode for omega?,SESU-P
44192,is that what you need?,SESU-P
44193,if we all need 4v shouldn't we all have a resistance of 470?,SESU-P
44194,now what,SESU-P
44195,27.5A?,SESU-P
44196,What is the current then?,SESU-P
44197,where are you now,SESU-P
44198,volts or ohms ?,SESU-P
44199,eagle whats your resistor value,SESU-P
44200,whats everyone reading now for voltage,SESU-P
44201,is our Amps right? these add up to more than 13V,SESU-P
44202,Shouldnt R0 be 1.72V?,SESU-P
44203,"but shouldnt R0,R1,R2,R3 voltages add up to 13v?",SESU-P
44204,"so who can read the amps, I think they are wrong",SESU-P
44205,11.65mA?,SESU-P
44206,does that make sense or am I missing something?,SESU-P
44207,then i need 220???,SESU-P
44208,Numbers peeps,SESU-P
44209,2.25V?,SESU-P
44210,9v total?,SESU-P
44211,but I think we still need to get the target?,SESU-P
44212,so I=.00331?,SESU-P
44213,"so if V is 9v, what is our I?",SESU-P
44214,0.0033amps?,SESU-P
44215,eagle is 345???,SESU-P
44216,how about now?,SESU-P
44217,now,SESU-P
44218,how bout now,SESU-P
44219,where are we at?,SESU-P
44220,Our target voltage combined should be (1.14+1.4+1.63=4.17) which means that the R0 is 4.83 right?,SESU-P
44221,which would mean 4.83V/680??=.0071Amp?,SESU-P
44222,sound off,SESU-P
44223,where are you guys at,SESU-P
44224,what volts does everyone need,SESU-P
44225,and you spaniel,SESU-P
44226,i think im doing the calculations wrong can someone remind me which one were doing?,SESU-P
44227,who's the farthest away from their goal?,SESU-P
44228,do yours jump from 180ohms to 220?,SESU-P
44229,are you at 2.08 now,SESU-P
44230,sound off,SESU-P
44231,what are you calculating?,SESU-P
44232,what is everyone at,SESU-P
44233,call out your voltages,SESU-P
44234,just to check. is everyone set to 10 ohms?,SESU-P
44235,is everyone's resistor at 10 ohms?,SESU-P
44236,whats your RO?,SESU-P
44237,"now my v=5, r=10 correct?",SESU-P
44238,the 10 you picked is what we divide by?,SESU-P
44239,or the RO?,SESU-P
44240,ok wat about you poodle,SESU-P
44241,wat now,SESU-P
44242,"the dmm should be set to 20, right?",SESU-P
44243,so  does yours randomly seem to change? like I got it on my goal but it shifts?,SESU-P
44244,so how should we do this?,SESU-P
44245,So who is Circuit 1?,SESU-P
44246,ok so should one of us move ours?,SESU-P
44247,or what number of volts do you have,SESU-P
44248,should I try to shift or?,SESU-P
44249,so who is Circuit 1?,SESU-P
44250,okay mashed what do you need?,SESU-P
44251,what is your goal?,SESU-P
44252,ok so we dont know our V intially?,SESU-P
44253,what are you at?,SESU-P
44254,"R = 220 ohms, V = 2.65, .1 from my goal. how far is everyone else from their goal?",SESU-P
44255,okay so fries?,SESU-P
44256,what's everyone at now vs. what they need to be? Me: 2.80; need 2.75,SESU-P
44257,what the mystery volts?,SESU-P
44258,what is everyone's voltage?,SESU-P
44259,ok so what formula are we going to use?,SESU-P
44260,How,SESU-P
44261,do we add up the resistances? or something?,SESU-P
44262,did you figure that out?,SESU-P
44263,What are the R values we got,SESU-P
44264,what's everyone's resistances,SESU-P
44265,my brain is fried... excuse the pun but what do we do with that ohms number?,SESU-P
44266,we have the total but what does that mean?,SESU-P
44267,hmm but dont we need I the current?,SESU-P
44268,why the extra 220ohms? its included in the 1670 total,SESU-P
44269,I =98? or?,SESU-P
44270,or am I doing this wrong?,SESU-P
44271,how?,SESU-P
44272,so I is .01018?,SESU-P
44273,ok?,SESU-P
44274,So the unknown value is 16.99V then right?,SESU-P
44275,total R was what again?,SESU-P
44276,what are we doing wrong,SESU-P
44277,lets start from the beginning: what is everyone's resistances,SESU-P
44278,Voltage drops?,SESU-P
44279,wouldnt that just be our measured voltage acrossed the resistor?,SESU-P
44280,the v for r0 would be 2.2396?,SESU-P
44281,oh?,SESU-P
44282,what... the,SESU-P
44283,whyyy,SESU-P
44284,why is that a thing!!,SESU-P

44291,do they all need to be 680?,SESU-P
44292,what is everyones target v,SESU-P
44293,do we want to try getting each target voltage one by one,SESU-P
44294,who is r1,SESU-P
44295,did it just change?,SESU-P
44296,so... whats the plan,SESU-P
44297,total or in addition to the 1000?,SESU-P
44298,what is everyones v?,SESU-P
44299,thoughts?,SESU-P
44300,should our goals add up to the starting v?,SESU-P
44301,how did you get v for r0?,SESU-P
44302,are you guys reading 6.57 amps,SESU-P
44303,is someones resistor unplugged?,SESU-P
44304,should it be different?,SESU-P

44312,8.89 for E?,SESU-P
44313,So the current is .015A right?,SESU-P
44314,So how would one get E,SESU-P
44315,Should we trying unhooking all of our power cords and see how much voltage is going through R0 while it's by itself?,SESU-P
44316,seagull will you do the measuring?,SESU-P
44317,If we break the connection and just hook the multimeters in series shouldn't that be the current for just R0?,SESU-P
44318,If the current is the same everywhere then cant we just measure the current on the multimeter,SESU-P
44319,anyone reading a current,SESU-P
44320,Everyones multimeter set to amps?,SESU-P
44321,"Your multimeter pointed somewhere in the top right, correct Hawk?",SESU-P

44325,what happened?,SESU-P
44326,my goal voltage is 7.23 v. Can y'all please tell me what you're doing to be able to solve this? I was still trying to solve it and it said we were right,SESU-P
44327,so where are we at?,SESU-P
44328,has it moved up .01?,SESU-P
44329,"spaniel, what is your goal?",SESU-P

44335,whos resistor 1,SESU-P
44336,are yall at your target voltage,SESU-P
44337,so we should all probably end up with the same resistance? Or am I crazy?,SESU-P
44338,whats your power supply and R0,SESU-P
44339,what does,SESU-P
44340,why are we measuring current?,SESU-P
44341,i think we just have to adjust the R value till it reads 2.5 volts right?,SESU-P
44342,Don't you need to know the current for V/I?,SESU-P
44343,so 7.52 should be the current for the whole circuit right?,SESU-P
44344,ok what we doing,SESU-P
44345,what's everyone's resistance?,SESU-P
44346,all 390?,SESU-P

44378,how'd you get .0079?,SESU-P
44379,what did you do?,SESU-P
44380,Ideas?,SESU-P

44784,how far,SESU-P
44785,what did that do to yours,SESU-P
44786,u guys are right next to eachother right?,SESU-P
44787,want me to go back down one?,SESU-P
44788,do you need to go up or down,SESU-P
44789,what are you now,SESU-P
44790,Where is the question? lol,SESU-P
44791,what does E mean,SESU-P
44792,Energy? Its just the input voltage idk,SESU-P
44793,LMAO why would you do that,SESU-P
44794,how about I move down 1 resistor and you can run back thru,SESU-P
44795,Two 470s and a 680?,SESU-P
44796,oh what,SESU-P
44797,"my volt is 2.26, eagle has 1.54 and what is your V seagull",SESU-P
44798,Does one have to increase while the other decreases?,SESU-P
44799,are you guys where you need to be voltage wise?,SESU-P
44800,how am i supposed to find current now,SESU-P
44801,any ideas how to find current,SESU-P
44802,whos at circut 1,SESU-P
44803,what,SESU-P
44804,anyone else?,SESU-P
44805,"i have my voltage now, how about you guys? im at 270 ohms",SESU-P

44810,are you able to change the resistor now?,SESU-P
44811,What is yours now,SESU-P
44812,"so if all of our resistors are 820 and the current is 6.1 i guess the voltage (E) is 21,320 V ? that doesn't sound right though",SESU-P
44813,how's that?,SESU-P
44814,Haha how are we at 0,SESU-P
44815,how about you collie?,SESU-P
44816,what are you at?,SESU-P
44817,Anyone get the r value,SESU-P
44818,Whatƒ??s your resistors at,SESU-P
44819,wot,SESU-P
44820,Should I change mine back away from 1k,SESU-P
44821,are we suppose to make a total of 3.75 v between the threee of us?,SESU-P
44822,which one should i use?,SESU-P
44823,hold on whats it read for yall,SESU-P
44824,Whats is your guys goal voltage?,SESU-P
44825,whats your resitsance?,SESU-P
44826,What's that,SESU-P
44827,How'd you guys calculate the current,SESU-P
44828,whats everyones goal voltahge,SESU-P
44829,the total whats everyones current,SESU-P
44830,let me know what it is mine says .2,SESU-P
44831,i got 13.2?,SESU-P
44832,u mean 200 u right?,SESU-P
44833,Should I go up one?,SESU-P
44834,whats it read,SESU-P
44835,isnt current suppose to be the same thru out,SESU-P
44836,then why are ours differnt,SESU-P
44837,What's everyone's target V's again,SESU-P
44838,What's your target,SESU-P

44840,Can I go up from 390 then,SESU-P
44841,mine ?,SESU-P
44842,hamster changed it?,SESU-P
44843,so we all need to make 3.5 volts or we have separate objectives or what?,SESU-P
44844,we need an R1 +R2 +R3 to equal what will give 3.5 right,SESU-P
44845,"so we probably all have the same resistance to get 3.5 each, right?",SESU-P
44846,or is it 3.5 total from our 3 combined,SESU-P
44847,"ooook, so that's 12V total, the other two are getting lost from the 180?",SESU-P
44848,so i think if we all put 180 we'll get 3.5 each right?,SESU-P
44849,what now?,SESU-P
44850,do we just hit nextr?,SESU-P
44851,so hit next?,SESU-P
44852,11.6?,SESU-P
44853,so i guess we all individually v=ir and see if we work out when we all plug our results in?,SESU-P
44854,how's it going wrench?,SESU-P
44855,what was your voltage goal?,SESU-P
44856,1.71?,SESU-P
44857,something wrong when you plug it in?,SESU-P
44858,So we should try to solve it for Voltage?,SESU-P
44859,"tro find E, do we need to figure out I?",SESU-P
44860,"wrench, what's your amps?",SESU-P
44861,now I have 2.6 micro amps?,SESU-P
44862,"idk why we have different currents, but perhaps we try individually and see what happens?",SESU-P
44863,is anyone putting in components,SESU-P
44864,okay so maybe we set up a particular resistance like we all take 1k resuistors,SESU-P
44865,did you have an idea in mind pliers?,SESU-P
44866,so our goal v/0.006 ma?,SESU-P
44867,use our total V used maybe?,SESU-P
44868,So V1 + V2 + V3 = V0?,SESU-P
44869,any ideas?,SESU-P
44870,shall we all try what we get with ohm's law and see if it works?,SESU-P
44871,how's it coming wrench?,SESU-P
44872,maybe we can brute force this my moving one resistor level at a time?,SESU-P
44873,what about using the amps that would eat up 5.42 V,SESU-P
44874,wait is that 10v - what we have?,SESU-P
44875,"The voltage drop, you mean?",SESU-P
44876,so why isn't it working,SESU-P
44877,Should we use a 4k Resistance load?,SESU-P
44878,"so when we put the right load the current will change and thus our sum will be off again, right?",SESU-P
44879,can we do this as a voltage divider where our three resisors are added to one and then it;s just the 1k and our aggregate?,SESU-P
44880,1.3413 mA?,SESU-P
44881,12.58 mA?,SESU-P
44882,so what can we do with our V drops and amps,SESU-P
44883,that way we keep our total neater?,SESU-P
44884,"wrench, whats your V",SESU-P
44885,three?,SESU-P
44886,how close to the goal voltage do we have to be,SESU-P
44887,not sure but to get the current would it be 12/220 or 12/.22,SESU-P
44888,are we each working on this together or each a have part in the circuit,SESU-P
44889,what are yall's resistors,SESU-P

44902,what do we need to get voltage drop again?,SESU-P
44903,circuit 2?,SESU-P
44904,who is circuit 1,SESU-P

45277,so is everyones E = 13 and R0 = 470,SESU-P
45278,what do your voltage need to be,SESU-P
45279,ok but what is I?,SESU-P
45280,can the multimeter measure it?,SESU-P
45281,wait if E = IR than can't we just find it using E and R0 and then apply that for each of our resistances since it stays the same throughout the curcuit,SESU-P
45282,im at 1.45. Hawk have you done it?,SESU-P
45283,hawk?,SESU-P

45315,are we done or are we supposed to finish?,SESU-P
45316,but isn't E=IxR,SESU-P
45317,so take what you get from the reading and multiply it with resistance?,SESU-P
45318,should we just stop and do the after questions?,SESU-P
45319,what are all yalls resistences,SESU-P
45320,What do we have to calculate I for?,SESU-P
45321,So we need E = 3. So 3/0.0255 = R = 117.65?,SESU-P
45322,So 117.65/3 = 39.2 per resistor?,SESU-P
45323,"That sounds good to me, but i don't know how we get it there. just experiment and pick random numbers?",SESU-P
45324,What are we supposed to do with that?,SESU-P
45325,How do we change the resistance?,SESU-P

45327,Was your voltage exactly 3?,SESU-P
45328,Are we keeping it on the DCV and changing the resistance?,SESU-P
45329,anyone have any ideas?,SESU-P
45330,"the only thing we can do is change the resistance, right?",SESU-P
45331,Don't we each have to have the same resistance?,SESU-P
45332,So when we are reading on 200 DCV what does that mean? Is the number displayed Volts?,SESU-P
45333,So is that the volts leaving or coming into our resistor?,SESU-P
45334,what resistance is everyone at,SESU-P
45335,Did everyone change to 270?,SESU-P
45336,Why did the volts drop when we decreased resistance? Shouldn't it have went up?,SESU-P

45391,WHAT,SESU-P
45392,Spill the beans,SESU-P
45393,Do we want 2.36?,SESU-P
45394,So should we go up or lower,SESU-P
45395,"i think, right?",SESU-P
45396,So are we looking for what times 680 gives us 4?,SESU-P
45397,ummm what volts are your guys' reading ?,SESU-P
45398,"Ive been playing around on my detector thing, where do you guys have the needle pointing?",SESU-P

45420,what circuit number are you,SESU-P
45421,do we just change the resistance? im not sure what to do,SESU-P
45422,are we trying to make the voltage across the resistor 4.5?,SESU-P
45423,so we need to find the current that makes it all work first then use that for the resistance right?,SESU-P
45424,what do we set the multimeter to,SESU-P
45425,whats your Ro?,SESU-P
45426,valley is it working for you?,SESU-P
45427,valley is yours on 330?,SESU-P

45429,we all got 4.5?,SESU-P
45430,is the only thing you can change resistance?,SESU-P
45431,is y'all goal voltage 1.75 too? mine is 1.75 volts,SESU-P
45432,are your wires connected,SESU-P
45433,any other ideas?,SESU-P
45434,if all of our goal voltages are 1.75V then are our resitances gonna be the same too? or nah,SESU-P
45435,r we supposed to calculate the voltage for R0 or something,SESU-P
45436,wat was the current,SESU-P
45437,if E is the sum of our individual V's then is it also the sum of our individual IR's?,SESU-P

45447,if everyone puts 390 ohms what will the voltage say?,SESU-P
45448,what about now?,SESU-P
45449,maybe we all have to add up to 820?,SESU-P
45450,what do you guys have the multimeter set at for amps?,SESU-P
45451,so I=22.1 amps?,SESU-P
45452,"basically bc the voltage drop is the same through each resistor, the resistance is going to be the same in each one, right?",SESU-P
45453,wym?,SESU-P
45454,So we just need to coordinate our resistances to get a total resistance that gives the correct voltage at the given current... Right?,SESU-P
45455,do we start by finding the overall resistance?,SESU-P
45456,by manipulating V = IR?,SESU-P
45457,so we have v and we can measure I right?,SESU-P
45458,i think we all should be getting the same result for that right?,SESU-P
45459,"No, I set resistance to 10 ohms??",SESU-P
45460,for what,SESU-P
45461,are your things on the outside of the resistor or somewhere else,SESU-P

45527,what did yall put for resistance?,SESU-P
45528,who has the first one,SESU-P
45529,do we have to be under 100omhs,SESU-P
45530,Is R0 the total?,SESU-P
45531,2V left or 2V as voltage drop for each resistor?,SESU-P
45532,would be the same eiter way right,SESU-P
45533,220k?,SESU-P
45534,why K?,SESU-P

46916,right. I set mine to 100 Ohms now,SN-A
46917,"I got .00834, but it's close enough",SN-A
46918,yes,SN-A
46919,i think so,SN-A
46920,"yes, im reading 2.75 v",SN-A
46921,yea mine is 2.75 volts,SN-A
46922,sure,SN-A
46923,yea,SN-A
46924,yuh,SN-A
46925,yea,SN-A
46926,i is,SN-A
46927,yea,SN-A
46928,yea its affected by all,SN-A
46929,yup,SN-A
46930,sure,SN-A
46931,yea,SN-A
46932,yes,SN-A
46933,Yeal it is on the top left,SN-A
46934,Yes I remember that,SN-A
46935,yep,SN-A
46936,yes,SN-A
46937,yup,SN-A
46938,yeah,SN-A
46939,yeah,SN-A
46940,true you can,SN-A
46941,TRUE,SN-A
46942,yeah it says its correct and the r0 is wrong,SN-A
46943,yes both values are correc,SN-A
46944,right,SN-A
46945,yea,SN-A
46946,so yes i guess,SN-A
46947,yes,SN-A
46948,yes,SN-A
46949,right,SN-A
46950,yep,SN-A
46951,yep,SN-A
46952,yes,SN-A
46953,yeah,SN-A
46954,we all do,SN-A
46955,ye,SN-A
46956,yeah,SN-A
46957,TRUE,SN-A
46958,y E s,SN-A
46959,seems legit,SN-A
46960,yeah,SN-A
46961,ye,SN-A
46962,Yea I also got 0.016,SN-A
46963,Yes,SN-A
46964,van you were rite,SN-A
46965,yea im the first circuit i think,SN-A
46966,yes and the multimeter,SN-A
46967,yea what value do u have on the resistor,SN-A
46968,yea my wires are connected,SN-A
46969,yea i can see the readings now,SN-A
46970,yepp,SN-A
46971,yep we got it,SN-A
46972,yea dcv,SN-A
46973,i think do,SN-A
46974,I think so,SN-A
46975,yeah i need 4,SN-A
46976,yea we can try that,SN-A
46977,yea 20 dcv,SN-A
46978,yup,SN-A
46979,yea,SN-A
46980,yeah,SN-A
46981,and yes i am circuit one,SN-A
46982,yeah go ahead,SN-A
46983,yes,SN-A
46984,yeah,SN-A
46985,on mine? yeah,SN-A
46986,yea,SN-A
46987,yeah,SN-A
46988,yeah E is unknown,SN-A
46989,Ya but we dont know which one yet,SN-A
46990,yeah it is,SN-A
46991,Ya,SN-A
46992,yes,SN-A
46993,yes,SN-A
46994,yes,SN-A
46995,yup,SN-A
46996,true that,SN-A
46997,yes thats the answer,SN-A
46998,yes that way we can adjust accordingly,SN-A
46999,Bear I agree,SN-A
47000,TRUE,SN-A
47001,Yes,SN-A
47002,i guess so,SN-A
47003,i think so,SN-A
47004,yea,SN-A
47005,yep,SN-A
47006,yep,SN-A
47007,yas,SN-A
47008,yep,SN-A
47009,Yep,SN-A
47010,yes,SN-A
47011,yes,SN-A
47012,yarp,SN-A
47013,"yea, i know",SN-A
47014,yea,SN-A
47015,ya,SN-A
47016,yep,SN-A
47017,"yes, mines at 680",SN-A
47018,yes,SN-A
47019,"yes, so are we setting the meter to 1k or what? i dont see a 1K setting",SN-A
47020,yeah gives IT,SN-A
47021,yeah would that be okay,SN-A
47022,"yea im getting closer, im at 1.56 right now",SN-A
47023,i think so,SN-A
47024,yea but we also need R0,SN-A
47025,yea,SN-A
47026,Yes,SN-A
47027,yea,SN-A
47028,yes,SN-A
47029,i do,SN-A
47030,thats what i got,SN-A
47031,nope,SN-A
47032,yeah mines wrong,SN-A
47033,"yeah, mine is messed",SN-A
47034,i think so,SN-A
47035,"yeah, but what resistence?",SN-A
47036,yes,SN-A
47037,yes,SN-A
47038,yeah,SN-A
47039,yeah,SN-A
47040,yeah,SN-A
47041,I believe,SN-A
47042,agree,SN-A
47043,"oh yeah, thats right.",SN-A
47044,Correct I = .0102273 A,SN-A
47045,I think so,SN-A
47046,yeet,SN-A
47047,Yeah that's what I got,SN-A
47048,yes!,SN-A
47049,ya its not super exact,SN-A
47050,ya i would choose that,SN-A
47051,yes,SN-A
47052,yes i get how the current was found,SN-A
47053,yup,SN-A
47054,yes,SN-A
47055,yeah maybe,SN-A
47056,ohhh dang ya makes sense,SN-A
47057,Yeah I think so,SN-A
47058,That's what I got,SN-A
47059,yup got that too,SN-A
47060,yes,SN-A
47061,yeah boi,SN-A
47062,yeah so dont do that from here on out?,SN-A
47063,Yes,SN-A
47064,Yes 1.75. It seems like maybe we should coordinate each move we make before one of us adjusts a value.,SN-A
47065,Yay,SN-A
47066,Yeah I can do it,SN-A
47067,yes,SN-A
47068,YAH,SN-A
47069,yes cake,SN-A
47070,i agrre,SN-A
47071,Yes,SN-A
47072,lol yes,SN-A
47073,Yea,SN-A
47074,I think,SN-A
47075,Yea ill try,SN-A
47076,true dat,SN-A
47077,yes,SN-A
47078,yes,SN-A
47079,yes,SN-A
47080,Yea,SN-A
47081,"we prob should, im down. North?",SN-A
47082,yea,SN-A
47083,yes,SN-A
47084,yes,SN-A
47085,yes its not helping,SN-A
47086,yes,SN-A
47087,yes,SN-A
47088,sure,SN-A
47089,or that yeah,SN-A
47090,now yes,SN-A
47091,i am now,SN-A
47092,yep,SN-A
47093,YAY,SN-A
47094,yes,SN-A
47095,yes,SN-A
47096,yes,SN-A
47097,yessir,SN-A
47098,yes,SN-A
47099,yep,SN-A
47100,yes,SN-A
47101,yeah i found that too,SN-A
47102,"oops sorry, yes, i just realized we can pull the resistor wires out of the board",SN-A
47103,sure,SN-A
47104,Yea sorry,SN-A
47105,Yea I agree,SN-A
47106,Sure but how will we do that?,SN-A
47107,"wait, i see, i think you're right",SN-A
47108,"sorry, your right",SN-A
47109,yup,SN-A
47110,Yea I broke it to measure the Current,SN-A
47111,Yes,SN-A
47112,yes,SN-A
47113,yeah that works,SN-A
47114,agreed,SN-A
47115,yes,SN-A
47116,Yes it is correct,SN-A
47117,yes,SN-A
47118,Yes,SN-A
47119,Yes,SN-A
47120,E is 19,SN-A
47121,yeah 820 should work i think. I added 3.25 3 times and then subtracted from 13 to find what voltage was left,SN-A
47122,and yeah  valley youre right,SN-A
47123,yeah,SN-A
47124,it is,SN-A
47125,yeah,SN-A
47126,yeah,SN-A
47127,yeah,SN-A
47128,valley is right,SN-A
47129,yes,SN-A
47130,yeah,SN-A
47131,yup,SN-A
47132,That makes sense,SN-A
47133,yea,SN-A
47134,That seems correct,SN-A
47135,yes,SN-A
47136,yea,SN-A
47137,I agree with Bear,SN-A
47138,yes,SN-A
47139,Agreed,SN-A
47140,yes,SN-A
47141,Yeah. I guess so?,SN-A
47142,"Sorry, youre right",SN-A
47143,Sure,SN-A
47144,yea,SN-A
47145,ya i was thinking that to,SN-A
47146,sure,SN-A
47147,Yea I just thought about that I think you are right Seagull,SN-A
47148,"Yea, let's try that",SN-A
47149,Yea that makes sense,SN-A
47150,Yea.  Im going to hop down some on resistance.,SN-A
47151,"Yea, 7.02 mA",SN-A
47152,"Yea, I think that is how we find our E using Ohms law, since our E=IR, and R is just the resistors summed up.",SN-A
47153,yup,SN-A
47154,yeah,SN-A
47155,yeah all of a sudden it went to 0 for a minute,SN-A
47156,yeah and I=0.009,SN-A
47157,yeah,SN-A
47158,yeah?,SN-A
47159,yes,SN-A
47160,yeah,SN-A
47161,yeah we need to get the correct voltage,SN-A
47162,yeah,SN-A
47163,that's correct,SN-A
47164,"Right, Presently my voltage drop is 4.2 volts and my resistor is 470",SN-A
47165,"Yeah, so the with all our voltage drops, the volt drop across R0 is 1.41 V",SN-A
47166,"yeah measure the resistor with the 2 leads, place them on each end of the resistor",SN-A
47167,Yes.,SN-A
47168,yeah mine has changed to 220?,SN-A
47169,Yeah. All the voltage drops accross the resistors need to add up to 3.5 volts.,SN-A
47170,"yes,",SN-A
47171,yes,SN-A
47172,yep,SN-A
47173,yep,SN-A
47174,yes,SN-A
47175,yeah agreed but im not sure what to do but im bout to start plugging in numbers and screw around,SN-A
47176,yeah and its 1217,SN-A
47177,correct,SN-A
47178,Yeah I got 2.75,SN-A
47179,ya I got the same,SN-A
47180,yeah resistor value,SN-A
47181,right? Were just not given much,SN-A
47182,yea,SN-A
47183,yes sorry,SN-A
47184,yeeeaaaa,SN-A
47185,yep,SN-A
47186,yes,SN-A
47187,yes.,SN-A
47188,yes,SN-A
47189,yep,SN-A
47190,already have on my side,SN-A
47191,yup,SN-A
47192,yep,SN-A
47193,yup,SN-A
47194,"yes, you double click it and you can change it",SN-A
47195,yes,SN-A
47196,that wat i menat,SN-A
47197,Thats what I got,SN-A
47198,Yup me too,SN-A
47199,yeah messing aroung,SN-A
47200,i think so,SN-A
47201,yeah,SN-A
47202,i think so,SN-A
47203,Yeah,SN-A
47204,That sounds right,SN-A
47205,yeah not sure about that,SN-A
47206,Yeah i think they all have to have a volt drop of 2,SN-A
47207,yea,SN-A
47208,that part is i think,SN-A
47209,"Yeah, I'm not quite sure what to do...",SN-A
47210,I think so,SN-A
47211,"ah, yeah, my bad",SN-A
47212,yes,SN-A
47213,either way works for me,SN-A
47214,that totally works,SN-A
47215,yes,SN-A
47216,yes,SN-A
47217,"right, after r0 the voltage drops",SN-A
47218,"yes, although my voltage is now 3.18",SN-A
47219,yes,SN-A
47220,yers,SN-A
47221,yes,SN-A
47222,exactly,SN-A
47223,righty,SN-A
47224,TRUE,SN-A
47225,yeah and then it would be .68V=100omhs*Current,SN-A
47226,true i agree with that,SN-A
47227,"to find voltage drop.........yeah, i think so",SN-A
47228,yes,SN-A
47229,"yeah, I figured it would not be precise.  it said I should have a resistor of about 100, 3.14V-219?? and 6.71V-468??",SN-A
47230,yup!,SN-A
47231,yup,SN-A
47232,mA* yeah,SN-A
47233,yes,SN-A
47234,yes,SN-A
47235,yeah but if we all get volts to reach we should be able to calculate the voltage at R0 and then calculate that A to give us a general idea,SN-A
47236,yes,SN-A
47237,yes,SN-A
47238,i think so,SN-A
47239,yes i understand that wat current did you get,SN-A
47240,yes. I = V/R,SN-A
47241,Yeah mines the same,SN-A
47242,Yes,SN-A
47243,Yes,SN-A
47244,14.76V is the total drop that we know. The voltage drop across R0 is I(220). and yes I is constant,SN-A
47245,yeh,SN-A
47246,Yes,SN-A
47247,yep,SN-A
47248,yes,SN-A
47249,yep/./,SN-A
47250,yep,SN-A
47251,yep,SN-A
47252,maybe it will,SN-A
47253,yes plus 4.91v for r0,SN-A
47254,yeah,SN-A
47255,yea,SN-A
47256,ya,SN-A
47257,yea,SN-A
47258,yea,SN-A
47259,yep,SN-A
47260,Ya i need 3.5V as well,SN-A
47261,Yup,SN-A
47262,"Abouts, ye",SN-A
47263,True True,SN-A
47264,yes i agree,SN-A
47265,ya,SN-A
47266,yes,SN-A
47267,yes,SN-A
47268,yep,SN-A
47269,yeah,SN-A
47270,yea,SN-A
47271,yes,SN-A
47272,yeah they are. is it ok if i have 2.48 V?,SN-A
47273,yes,SN-A
47274,yeah sounds right,SN-A
47275,"yeah, i'm at like 3.5 now",SN-A
47276,oh yeah that,SN-A
47277,yeah,SN-A
47278,YES!!!,SN-A
47279,YES,SN-A
47280,yeah me too shit,SN-A
47281,"yep i was right i figured it out, you can do them all based on ratios of the first resistor to volt drop",SN-A
47282,that sounds about right - I calculated 175,SN-A
47283,yes,SN-A
47284,yeah its 5.36 V,SN-A
47285,yes,SN-A
47286,"Yeah, you might want to check my math",SN-A
47287,yes,SN-A
47288,thats right,SN-A
47289,Yep,SN-A
47290,lets see,SN-A
47291,Yep!,SN-A
47292,Yes,SN-A
47293,Yep,SN-A
47294,yee,SN-A
47295,yea thats fine,SN-A
47296,it was probably wrong,SN-A
47297,oh yea thats what i did,SN-A
47298,no i think thats right,SN-A
47299,that works better for me,SN-A
47300,yes,SN-A
47301,yes,SN-A
47302,yeah,SN-A
47303,yupppp,SN-A
47304,yup yup,SN-A
47305,yeah,SN-A
47306,yea thats what i got,SN-A
47307,yeah im getting 270 ohms,SN-A
47308,yup,SN-A
47309,yup,SN-A
47310,yes,SN-A
47311,Yeah,SN-A
47312,yea that makes sense,SN-A
47313,Yes,SN-A
47314,Yes,SN-A
47315,"Yeah, if we all know our resistances and we know the current, we can find E",SN-A
47316,Yes,SN-A
47317,"Yeah, I got the same thing",SN-A
47318,Yeah,SN-A
47319,yea 14 works,SN-A
47320,Right,SN-A
47321,yeah,SN-A
47322,Sure,SN-A
47323,yeah,SN-A
47324,Yes,SN-A
47325,yeah,SN-A
47326,right,SN-A
47327,Yep,SN-A
47328,yea thats where im at,SN-A
47329,"yeah, i think if one person changes it effects us all",SN-A
47330,ya,SN-A
47331,yeee 3.25,SN-A
47332,wait yah same,SN-A
47333,yep,SN-A
47334,yes,SN-A
47335,yeah,SN-A
47336,yeah,SN-A
47337,yeah mine just went to 1.7,SN-A
47338,heck ya,SN-A
47339,believe so,SN-A
47340,yes,SN-A
47341,yeah thats what mine is at,SN-A
47342,yeah,SN-A
47343,i think so,SN-A
47344,yes,SN-A
47345,yea but then why does it give R already,SN-A
47346,Yeah,SN-A
47347,yeah,SN-A
47348,ya,SN-A
47349,I guess,SN-A
47350,yup,SN-A
47351,yea but then what is I,SN-A
47352,yes,SN-A
47353,yes,SN-A
47354,yea i changed it to 1K to see the R0 value,SN-A
47355,yea we can change it back but how else would we find the voltage for R0?,SN-A
47356,"yeah, but what is it. like which number would that be on the top",SN-A
47357,yea i get .00156 which doesnt seem right,SN-A
47358,yea that is but we dont know I,SN-A
47359,ya,SN-A
47360,yeah,SN-A
47361,oh yea right,SN-A
47362,yea i think thats right,SN-A
47363,yeah,SN-A
47364,it seems right,SN-A
47365,"yeah, I thought so too",SN-A
47366,yeah,SN-A
47367,yeah,SN-A
47368,yeah because we all i have to get the values on the top but when one does match we all dont,SN-A
47369,yeah,SN-A
47370,yeh what your vaules,SN-A
47371,yeha,SN-A
47372,i guess so,SN-A
47373,yeh,SN-A
47374,ye,SN-A
47375,yeah,SN-A
47376,yeha but the reading isnt a number in the resistor,SN-A
47377,you bet,SN-A
47378,yes,SN-A
47379,TRUE,SN-A
47380,yeah same!,SN-A
47381,yup great job guys,SN-A
47382,"Yeah, i think so",SN-A
47383,"yeah, it says mine is incorrect too",SN-A
47384,I got 1630 Ohms yes,SN-A
47385,yes,SN-A
47386,"Yeah i got a message saying that our readings are correct, it's just our E that isn't",SN-A
47387,yeah i got that too but it still says E is wrong...,SN-A
47388,Yeah exactly,SN-A
47389,yeah maybe!,SN-A
47390,Yes,SN-A
47391,yes,SN-A
47392,Current would be in Amps so yes i believe so,SN-A
47393,yes,SN-A
47394,Yes!,SN-A
47395,"yeah, the equation is IxR0 + V1 + V2 +V3",SN-A
47396,yeah that's what i got,SN-A
47397,yes!,SN-A
47398,yeah i got that too!,SN-A
47399,yes,SN-A
47400,yeah,SN-A
47401,Yeah but I think when you change your resistors values it changes mine as well,SN-A
47402,yup,SN-A
47403,yeah try that,SN-A
47404,yes,SN-A
47405,Yeah it says my E is correct,SN-A
47406,yeah rounded,SN-A
47407,i believe so,SN-A
47408,i think so,SN-A
47409,i believe so,SN-A
47410,ya,SN-A
47411,i think seagull is right,SN-A
47412,yep,SN-A
47413,i mean we can try that,SN-A
47414,"i think so, if you look below it has R0 in series with the other resistances",SN-A
47415,i agree,SN-A
47416,oh then yeah,SN-A
47417,yes,SN-A
47418,yeah,SN-A
47419,yeah you're right,SN-A
47420,yeah that would give us I though to be able to find E?,SN-A
47421,yeah we did,SN-A
47422,Kinda,SN-A
47423,Yeah i was just thinking that. What are yall at?,SN-A
47424,Yes,SN-A
47425,oh no yeah,SN-A
47426,yes,SN-A
47427,yea,SN-A
47428,yes,SN-A
47429,hell yes,SN-A
47430,yes,SN-A
47431,yup,SN-A
47432,yerr,SN-A
47433,TRUE,SN-A
47434,yeah,SN-A
47435,yep,SN-A
47436,exactly,SN-A
47437,yea,SN-A
47438,yeah,SN-A
47439,ya,SN-A
47440,yup,SN-A
47441,yea thats what my currrent is too,SN-A
47442,yea,SN-A
47443,yea and v in is 18V,SN-A
47444,yea i got that,SN-A
47445,yea,SN-A
47446,yea i think so,SN-A
47447,yeah,SN-A
47448,yea,SN-A
47449,yea,SN-A
47450,has to be cause than that adds up to 18,SN-A
47451,yup so now we find the current through that one,SN-A
47452,yea current is 5.48 milli,SN-A
47453,ya we need to find our current voltage with the same resistamce,SN-A
47454,yea,SN-A
47455,yeah,SN-A
47456,yup,SN-A
47457,yea,SN-A
47458,your right i heard wrong,SN-A
47459,yeah mili,SN-A
47460,yea,SN-A
47461,yup,SN-A
47462,yea  hold on,SN-A
47463,yea,SN-A
47464,yea,SN-A
47465,yeash same,SN-A
47466,"Yeah. If i go down to 120, it's in the .8 region",SN-A
47467,Yeah,SN-A
47468,Yea,SN-A
47469,yep right,SN-A
47470,Yer,SN-A
47471,Yea leave it at 327,SN-A
47472,yea my bad,SN-A
47473,Yea you're the last resistor in the series,SN-A
47474,Yep lol Dog you're right next to me I just saw my chat pop on on your screen,SN-A
47475,Yea in series,SN-A
47476,I think dog was right with all of us doing 150ohm,SN-A
47477,yes,SN-A
47478,yea,SN-A
47479,it does,SN-A
47480,yeah we're all in series it would seem,SN-A
47481,aye,SN-A
47482,yep,SN-A
47483,Seems so,SN-A
47484,"yeah I'm 270, I have it in",SN-A
47485,aye same i'm getting closer to my goal,SN-A
47486,Ye,SN-A
47487,"Yeah, it's like 220 roughly",SN-A
47488,yes,SN-A
47489,yeah,SN-A
47490,If I change my resistance yeah.,SN-A
47491,"Yeah, 6 mA.",SN-A
47492,yeah 24 I have,SN-A
47493,yeah,SN-A
47494,"Yeah, I just did it, mb",SN-A
47495,yeah 5.42,SN-A
47496,yeah I was about to say i think we made a logical error,SN-A
47497,yeah,SN-A
47498,right,SN-A
47499,Yeah.,SN-A
47500,yeah scratch that,SN-A
47501,Yeah,SN-A
47502,"Yeah, now we need to find both E and R0.",SN-A
47503,yeah 8.76,SN-A
47504,right,SN-A
47505,"right, then use the amps we find there",SN-A
47506,yeah,SN-A
47507,"Yeah, since they're in series that'd be cleaner",SN-A
47508,Yeah,SN-A
47509,yeah,SN-A
47510,"Yeah, we gave it a solid run though",SN-A
47511,yes,SN-A
47512,yes,SN-A
47513,yes,SN-A
47514,yes,SN-A
47515,yeah,SN-A
47516,yes but my voltage needs to be 5.06,SN-A
47517,yes,SN-A
47518,"yeah, yall getting 9 volts?",SN-A
47519,yes,SN-A
47520,yeah we have the same problems,SN-A
47521,yeah but we can calculate it if we all set r to 0 and find the current,SN-A
47522,ya,SN-A
47523,yeah lmao,SN-A
47524,yeah i think so,SN-A
47525,yeah and its series so (r0+r1+r2+r3)?,SN-A
47526,yeah,SN-A
47527,yeah,SN-A
47528,yes,SN-A
47529,yes,SN-A
47530,i would agree. I think the only thing we can change is the resistor,SN-A
47531,yeah,SN-A
47532,yes,SN-A
47533,yeah,SN-A
47534,yeah,SN-A
47535,correct,SN-A
47536,yeah!! we broke it until we made it,SN-A
47537,yea 4.5,SN-A
47538,yeah,SN-A
47539,yeah,SN-A
47540,yeah I kept seeing that. your trying to get your resistor on your circuit to the voltage listed above,SN-A
47541,yea i caught that,SN-A
47542,yea thats my problem,SN-A
47543,u rite u rite,SN-A
47544,"yea, and i dont have the formula memorized or anything so",SN-A
47545,@van yea,SN-A
47546,yup,SN-A
47547,yes 680,SN-A
47548,ya same like me,SN-A
47549,yaaa,SN-A
47550,thats right,SN-A
47551,yeah,SN-A
47552,yes trying it,SN-A
47553,YAA,SN-A
47554,OK WAIT,SN-A
47555,yes wre did,SN-A
47556,YA ITS NEAR TO 30 -50 K,SN-A
47557,yup,SN-A
47558,"Yeah it is, but current changes too",SN-A
47559,yea cuz then we can calc it,SN-A
47560,think so,SN-A
47561,yep,SN-A
47562,yep,SN-A
47563,agree,SN-A
47564,Yeah me too,SN-A
47565,I think so,SN-A
47566,yup,SN-A
47567,yep,SN-A
47568,yeah,SN-A
47569,yaya,SN-A
47570,if its over 20 volts yes,SN-A
47571,yes,SN-A
47572,yep,SN-A
47573,yes,SN-A
47574,"yep, i cant chang my resistor",SN-A
47575,yep,SN-A
47576,yes,SN-A
47577,yea do that,SN-A
47578,should be .075 as you said,SN-A
47579,yes,SN-A
47580,yep im there,SN-A
47581,"yup, 22",SN-A
47582,"yeah, we shouldnt all have the same ohms",SN-A
47583,yep,SN-A
47584,yeah go up if you need red,SN-A
47585,yeah,SN-A
47586,yes i do,SN-A
47587,si correcto,SN-A
47588,yep,SN-A
47589,yes,SN-A
47590,yep,SN-A
47591,yes,SN-A
47592,yeah go,SN-A
47593,thats what im thinking,SN-A
47594,yeah im over mine rn,SN-A
47595,yep,SN-A
47596,yep,SN-A
47597,agreed,SN-A
47598,yep,SN-A
47599,yeah im sure there is but do any of us actually know,SN-A
47600,yeah,SN-A
47601,yea accidentally put me in practice mode,SN-A
47602,yes,SN-A
47603,yes,SN-A
47604,yes,SN-A
47605,Yuh,SN-A
47606,ya one sec,SN-A
47607,Yurh,SN-A
47608,Yeah mine moves on its own as well,SN-A
47609,yes,SN-A
47610,lol yes,SN-A
47611,Mine is,SN-A
47612,yeah 1.59,SN-A
47613,yeah,SN-A
47614,Yup,SN-A
47615,yeah,SN-A
47616,yea,SN-A
47617,yeah,SN-A
47618,ok yea so divide your goal voltage by that and then subtract your r0 to get the resistor you need,SN-A
47619,yeah but i dont follow the math,SN-A
47620,Yea I know E is the voltage,SN-A
47621,yea im getting a voltage,SN-A
47622,yea same,SN-A
47623,thats correct celery,SN-A
47624,yeah mine says 11.32 now,SN-A
47625,yeah they should all be the same as R but we have to figure out what the current is first,SN-A
47626,yea,SN-A
47627,yup,SN-A
47628,yeah haha,SN-A
47629,yeah same,SN-A
47630,yeah i have 2.75,SN-A
47631,yeah,SN-A
47632,yeah we are,SN-A
47633,yeah same,SN-A
47634,for sure i just dont know how,SN-A
47635,yes,SN-A
47636,yeah me too,SN-A
47637,yes please save us,SN-A
47638,yeah mine just went down again,SN-A
47639,it should be,SN-A
47640,yeah,SN-A
47641,yup,SN-A
47642,ya,SN-A
47643,go one up more,SN-A
47644,yeah...,SN-A
47645,yes but  what is the value of I,SN-A
47646,yeah,SN-A
47647,yes by clicking on it,SN-A
47648,yeah my goal is 4.75,SN-A
47649,But yes my goal is supposed to be 4.75,SN-A
47650,yea same here,SN-A
47651,no,SN-A
47652,yeah everything is right we just have to find E,SN-A
47653,yeah,SN-A
47654,yeah mine keeps changing. it was at 3 a minute ago,SN-A
47655,Yes.,SN-A
47656,I think because we are just reading the volts,SN-A
47657,Yes I think so. And each of our resistances must add up to the total R.,SN-A
47658,"Yeah, i think its DC voltage",SN-A
47659,okay yeah mine is at 1.91 now,SN-A
47660,yeah,SN-A
47661,Yeah mine is at the max and still says o,SN-A
47662,yeah it is,SN-A
47663,Yeah,SN-A
47664,Should be.,SN-A
47665,yes,SN-A
47666,Yes,SN-A
47667,ype,SN-A
47668,Yes,SN-A
47669,yes,SN-A
47670,Yes,SN-A
47671,yes,SN-A
47672,yeah r0 is the same for all,SN-A
47673,yeah so let's start by having every one measure their current voltage,SN-A
47674,"Yeah, I see that now. Lol",SN-A
47675,yEah^,SN-A
47676,"Yeap, that is what mine says",SN-A
47677,yeah exactly,SN-A
47678,yeah mine is 3.61 now,SN-A
47679,Yes!,SN-A
47680,yassss,SN-A
47681,okay lets do 1,SN-A
47682,YES!!!!!,SN-A
47683,yes,SN-A
47684,Right. Lol,SN-A
47685,yes,SN-A
47686,yea click the resistance,SN-A
47687,yes ik,SN-A
47688,yea i think so,SN-A
47689,yes,SN-A
47690,yeah,SN-A
47691,yea mines at 20 dcv,SN-A
47692,true true,SN-A
47693,yeah,SN-A
47694,yeah,SN-A
47695,yep,SN-A
47696,yeah it is,SN-A
47697,yeah its garbage,SN-A
47698,yea we all needa have a reading of 1.75 and if we put a voltmeter to R0 that'd have a reading of 1.75 too,SN-A
47699,yes,SN-A
47700,"also, yes mine too",SN-A
47701,that's what I think,SN-A
47702,agreed,SN-A
47703,yes,SN-A
47704,yes,SN-A
47705,Yep,SN-A
47706,yeah,SN-A
47707,yeah we should just go through them until we get 2.75,SN-A
47708,that's what ive been thinking,SN-A
47709,yeah,SN-A
47710,yes',SN-A
47711,It is,SN-A
47712,Yeah it's only giving me the options of 330 and 390,SN-A
47713,yea try 120,SN-A
47714,"Yeah, do we all  have the same required voltage?",SN-A
47715,Yes my current is close to that 0.012064,SN-A
47716,Yep I'm in the same boat,SN-A
47717,yes,SN-A
47718,yep,SN-A
47719,yep,SN-A
47720,thats what I got,SN-A
47721,Yassssss,SN-A
47722,you right,SN-A
47723,yeah and im reading that as my out,SN-A
47724,yeah,SN-A
47725,"Yeah mines off, I think all resistors have to be the right value before the voltage readings are right",SN-A
47726,yep,SN-A
47727,yes,SN-A
47728,yes 8v,SN-A
47729,yeah im calculting around 200ish,SN-A
47730,yeah,SN-A
47731,no,SN-D
47732,our voltage and current to get R,SN-D
47733,you dont need to change resistance value in Multimeter,SN-D
47734,no,SN-D
47735,I got 9.73V total,SN-D
47736,"Actually, no you can't",SN-D
47737,"Nope, I got .0104 for the current",SN-D
47738,Nope,SN-D
47739,Well that's not right,SN-D
47740,I don't know if that will actually help though since we don't have R0,SN-D
47741,total voltage shouldn't change,SN-D
47742,no,SN-D
47743,"nah, 2.63",SN-D
47744,not really,SN-D
47745,i dont think so,SN-D
47746,nooooooo dont,SN-D
47747,nah im feelin 68,SN-D
47748,nah,SN-D
47749,that aint right,SN-D
47750,no cuz it hella lowers me,SN-D
47751,we cant be the same cuz E is unknown know,SN-D
47752,"naw, too 100 this time",SN-D
47753,"yall do it yet? naw, 100",SN-D
47754,nope. cant do crap until we get e or r0,SN-D
47755,no 1.99,SN-D
47756,that's not going to matter,SN-D
47757,"no, it still says 0",SN-D
47758,nope not it,SN-D
47759,no we need just E,SN-D
47760,no,SN-D
47761,"the last one, yes...not this one i dont think",SN-D
47762,no u,SN-D
47763,ok thats definetly wrong,SN-D
47764,n o,SN-D
47765,ok i can't,SN-D
47766,It doesnt work it puts in the 0.65,SN-D
47767,You have to get a 2,SN-D
47768,not .22,SN-D
47769,we have to be exactly at 2,SN-D
47770,car nooooooooooooooo,SN-D
47771,"nope, it refuses",SN-D
47772,i have,SN-D
47773,nope all the resistors didnt work,SN-D
47774,yea but along with ours theres an unknown one also in the series,SN-D
47775,no no stay!,SN-D
47776,nooo i need to go way higher than 150,SN-D
47777,yeah but even if youre only .01 off both of us are farther becuase they are all connected,SN-D
47778,I dont think its working,SN-D
47779,it was workingfor me,SN-D
47780,"it is on 180 , thats not the answer",SN-D
47781,no,SN-D
47782,no mine is at 6.7,SN-D
47783,"no, use V0=4.5",SN-D
47784,no,SN-D
47785,your value is wrong,SN-D
47786,150 is not the answer,SN-D
47787,150 is def not the answer,SN-D
47788,That's false tiget,SN-D
47789,i cant go lower,SN-D
47790,"no, we have to make our own boards 4.25",SN-D
47791,i dont think i should be at 2.2k,SN-D
47792,"no, green is 329.82",SN-D
47793,thats 5.4 not 4.5,SN-D
47794,not me,SN-D
47795,only 390,SN-D
47796,no what i did was correct,SN-D
47797,nope mine are both on,SN-D
47798,wait no i had that,SN-D
47799,nope back,SN-D
47800,nope,SN-D
47801,no 2ez,SN-D
47802,but it still didn't give me the right vallues,SN-D
47803,Looks like 3810 isn't it either,SN-D
47804,No your resistor,SN-D
47805,no,SN-D
47806,"Guys guessing wont help, theres over 1000 combinations",SN-D
47807,no,SN-D
47808,no,SN-D
47809,r value is wrong,SN-D
47810,no,SN-D
47811,i don't think so,SN-D
47812,no i calculated it,SN-D
47813,But we need to do it down the line,SN-D
47814,"No, R0 is 680",SN-D
47815,But that gives a negative thing,SN-D
47816,"I don't think either, it's in micro, which is 10^-6 right?",SN-D
47817,"That's not your resister value, thats the resister value of the resister we don't contorl",SN-D
47818,"No, across the wires",SN-D
47819,wrong,SN-D
47820,no...,SN-D
47821,no. It changed. I can change it back if you want.,SN-D
47822,no need total resistance,SN-D
47823,no .5,SN-D
47824,no change the ohm value on the resistor,SN-D
47825,"no 1,2,3",SN-D
47826,No right now I am at 6.8 and I need 5.71,SN-D
47827,no at 2.19 need 3.28,SN-D
47828,no the green wires,SN-D
47829,"no R0 is the first resistor which is 820, should be at the top of your screen",SN-D
47830,no i think if our voltages all need to be 2.75 if we times that by 3 we get 8.25,SN-D
47831,it didn't work,SN-D
47832,nope,SN-D
47833,nope,SN-D
47834,"no, because 11 volts isnt across r0",SN-D
47835,"the problem is, as soon as one of us changes resistance, the whole current changes",SN-D
47836,"the problem with that is as soon as we change our resistance, the voltages for everybody else will change too",SN-D
47837,no,SN-D
47838,thats no right,SN-D
47839,nope,SN-D
47840,calculations won't work. we're each changing the current when we adjust,SN-D
47841,thats what i thought but poodle has a  pint,SN-D
47842,how do you mean spaniel that is not possibly,SN-D
47843,no. set the resistor to 10 ohm,SN-D
47844,incorrect,SN-D
47845,no so we have to come up with it at the end,SN-D
47846,no it's less than one. I got E = 16.999,SN-D
47847,nope,SN-D
47848,I just did that ... and the answer is 16.9996 which is a no go still,SN-D
47849,we did that as well,SN-D
47850,increasing doesnt get me anywhere close to my goal,SN-D
47851,that wont work,SN-D
47852,"nope, just tried to submit that for E.",SN-D
47853,i didnt think so,SN-D
47854,but the amps are not the same,SN-D
47855,nope,SN-D
47856,"Shouldn't disconnect all of our resistors? If only one of use removes theirs and hooks up the multimeter, we'll have to worry about the other resistors",SN-D
47857,we won't need to worry about the other resistors because there is no current when the connection is broken,SN-D
47858,"There should be current if the multimeters are hooked connected, there are four resistors, one we don't control",SN-D
47859,"but when measuring voltage the connection is essentially broken; no connection, no current. When measuring current it is a complete connection",SN-D
47860,nope,SN-D
47861,nope. not accepting it,SN-D
47862,no,SN-D
47863,no i have not.,SN-D
47864,no,SN-D
47865,nah I just changed the R until i got 2.5 on the multimeter,SN-D
47866,nah that gave me 0.4 ohms for the resistance,SN-D
47867,No - R3,SN-D
47868,pretty sure that cheating but,SN-D
47869,i did not get 17.6,SN-D
47870,"nope. i got 0.0079 A, but im sure thats wrong",SN-D
47871,i didnt,SN-D
47872,No....,SN-D
47873,no,SN-D
47874,that's not mine,SN-D
47875,oh no,SN-D
47876,"No, im not at the target",SN-D
47877,not seeing anything,SN-D
47878,They don't like like they are when I check your circute,SN-D
47879,peaches numbers line up for me,SN-D
47880,to 150,SN-D
47881,no,SN-D
47882,i don't think so,SN-D
47883,well for all resistors we either have a value for resistance or a voltage drop but we dont have both in any cases,SN-D
47884,"oh, our current changes as we change our resistors, so that current doesn't work after we calculate 14v",SN-D
47885,nah pot 470 you 390,SN-D
47886,yeah but there isnt a 140 option,SN-D
47887,no are all of our e values different?,SN-D
47888,nope,SN-D
47889,nope,SN-D
47890,no,SN-D
47891,no did you,SN-D
47892,no,SN-D
47893,no i think change the resistor to the R0 value,SN-D
47894,No I think we are still supposed to get the voltage value given to us,SN-D
47895,no thats just adding up the resistance values i think,SN-D
47896,which doesnt seem right,SN-D
47897,nope,SN-D
47898,its not right,SN-D
47899,ahhh no way,SN-D
47900,oh no,SN-D
47901,no,SN-D
47902,i dont think so,SN-D
47903,nope it says its incorrect,SN-D
47904,"Actually, that doesn't work...",SN-D
47905,No,SN-D
47906,No,SN-D
47907,no,SN-D
47908,"No, we have to guess the Voltage of the battery",SN-D
47909,not on my end,SN-D
47910,no i got something diffferent,SN-D
47911,no 3,SN-D
47912,theres 4 resistors,SN-D
47913,lol nah bro im pretty sure theres only 3,SN-D
47914,no v/i,SN-D
47915,but it doesnt read 4.5v,SN-D
47916,i got 3.39 for current,SN-D
47917,not 200m,SN-D
47918,Ours aren't tho,SN-D
47919,Yea the sums were'nt right,SN-D
47920,we're not taking account r0,SN-D
47921,but we also have to account for that 180 ohm,SN-D
47922,10.5...not 12,SN-D
47923,"Nah, I got it now",SN-D
47924,no wait there is nothing near a 355,SN-D
47925,but thatll just give 4000,SN-D
47926,"No, like the sum of the goal Vs",SN-D
47927,no it's 24V minus the V drop of the 1K,SN-D
47928,"well, it's series, so there is no divider",SN-D
47929,no wait that has two unknowns anyways,SN-D
47930,no since the resistor we can't change,SN-D
47931,no the reading,SN-D
47932,"i know, but now we know e, we can calculate I",SN-D
47933,i don't think we can change the resistors freely,SN-D
47934,but we can't change r0,SN-D
47935,nah cause when you change yours itll change teh v across mine,SN-D
47936,nah i'm at 0,SN-D
47937,i dont think so,SN-D
47938,nah E=V0+V1+V2+V3,SN-D
47939,not ohms,SN-D
47940,no bear did you,SN-D
47941,no was reading 2.63 on 120 but it keeps changing because bear is :(,SN-D
47942,680k is too much,SN-D
47943,no i think we need it,SN-D
47944,NOOOO,SN-D
47945,NO 18K LOW,SN-D
47946,not working for me,SN-D
47947,NO ITS REDUCED,SN-D
47948,Nah that's volts,SN-D
47949,i thought that was the voltage that changed,SN-D
47950,nah fam,SN-D
47951,so i don't think that works,SN-D
47952,nah,SN-D
47953,nah,SN-D
47954,nope,SN-D
47955,not me,SN-D
47956,"no, at 3.11",SN-D
47957,no,SN-D
47958,"doesn't make a difference tho, just adds a negative",SN-D
47959,it might,SN-D
47960,nope,SN-D
47961,"Nah it's too low that way, If I set mine up the next should go down I think",SN-D
47962,noooo,SN-D
47963,no,SN-D
47964,No im just thinking out loud,SN-D
47965,no 200 ohms,SN-D
47966,there isn't a resistance less than 10 ohms so sqrt of 1.8987 isn't going to work,SN-D
47967,Now its not working,SN-D
47968,I dont think it depends on us having the same resistance,SN-D
47969,"true, but if the resistances are the same then the voltage drops must be the same",SN-D
47970,you dont need to subtract the r0 resistor,SN-D
47971,no the total resistance is the resistance of all three of us  and the r0,SN-D
47972,i got 0.036 A,SN-D
47973,Forgot to subtract,SN-D
47974,I thought you said current was .036,SN-D
47975,no celery said that,SN-D
47976,nope,SN-D
47977,i got .006 as the current. not .017,SN-D
47978,We cant,SN-D
47979,that's for voltage,SN-D
47980,the current would rather go through the ammeter and not the resistor if you did that,SN-D
47981,"the meter ends have to be in series with the resistor, not in parallel, to measure resistance",SN-D
47982,no to measure resistance you can put the leads across the resistor like with voltage,SN-D
47983,sleet go up 1 level of resistance,SN-D
47984,no it only measures resistance I think,SN-D
47985,you're going the wrong way,SN-D
47986,No I am just asking,SN-D
47987,different equation,SN-D
47988,nope,SN-D
47989,Nooo blue you were holding us together,SN-D
47990,I'm not ready,SN-D
47991,No I think the meter reads current,SN-D
47992,Wait thats good,SN-D
47993,Ik that isnt an option tho,SN-D
47994,no DCV,SN-D
47995,"2.2 is too high, were trying to get it to 4",SN-D
47996,no i am a little confused,SN-D
47997,i think we are just looking for the voltage,SN-D
47998,but thats not an option,SN-D
47999,mine isnt,SN-D
48000,no bc total resistance is just added up between the three resistors,SN-D
48001,"I don't think each one of us have to have the same resistor, but yeah we all need to have 2.75 volts drop",SN-D
48002,no but they do need to be the same,SN-D
48003,"yes, but to find the voltage drop at each resistor you have to use V=IR",SN-D
48004,I thought 'I' was the 11 volts,SN-D
48005,no voltage (V) is in volts,SN-D
48006,no mine needs to be 3.21,SN-D
48007,not up,SN-D
48008,"nah just checked it, thats right. 4.5 volts over each resistor",SN-D
48009,no,SN-D
48010,"nope, I'm at 5.08 volts",SN-D
48011,Not an option,SN-D
48012,No my left,SN-D
48013,I cant 185,SN-D
48014,No its supposed to stay the same I think we got it,SN-D
48015,8 is power supply we want drop of 2,SN-D
48016,nope,SN-D
48017,"Ok, since this is a series circuit we all should have the same current",SN-R
48022,try both,SN-R
48023,3.75V,SSI-O
48024,15/4 is 3.75 not,SSI-O
48025,E is 15 volts for me aswell,SSI-O
48026,2.79,SSI-O
48027,3.36v,SSI-O
48028,.71V,SSI-O
48029,So iR0 is equal to 1 kOhm,SSI-O
48030,My DCV is currently at 20,SSI-O
48031,so our voltages are total 6.8,SSI-O
48032,which leaves 7.2 for the R0,SSI-O
48033,Since I1=IT,SSI-O
48034,So it would be 7.2mA times our unknown resistance to get our given voltage,SSI-O
48035,R=V/I or V= IR,SSI-O
48036,Voltage divider rule,SSI-O
48037,my answer was 466.666 and that was the closest available,SSI-O
48038,The reason I thought it dis something was because it seems we can all affect each others answers,SSI-O
48039,Mine is set to the closest value,SSI-O
48040,0.71 ( my voltage) divided by the current (.00714) nets me 99.43 Ohms,SSI-O
48041,The closest is 100 Ohms for me,SSI-O
48042,0.76,SSI-O
48043,but supposed to be .71,SSI-O
48044,"since we have 14, if that makes sense",SSI-O
48045,mine is kinda fluctuating from 0 now so I assume someone is changing their resistance,SSI-O
48046,because I know E= IxR,SSI-O
48047,ok so E and R0 is 1.94 repeating,SSI-O
48048,not rounded it's like,SSI-O
48049,.00714 A,SSI-O
48050,we're given all values after all,SSI-O
48051,"so if your goal is 2.79, your formula is 2.79/ .00714",SSI-O
48052,I got 390.76,SSI-O
48053,"There's a 390, but no 391 so I guess just a 390 is fine",SSI-O
48054,2.43,SSI-O
48055,.65 volts is my goal,SSI-O
48056,mine is 3.57V,SSI-O
48057,The sum of ours is 6.65,SSI-O
48058,0.00243,SSI-O
48059,We don't have the Vs tho,SSI-O
48060,i get negative numbers or 0.  I am lost.,SSI-O
48061,i currently have 2.0volts with a 180 ohm resistor,SSI-O
48062,"Okay, so now my voltage reading is 0 with the 180 ohm resistor",SSI-O
48063,this will be  easier if we had the current,SSI-O
48064,we only have total voltage and R0 and our assigned resistor,SSI-O
48065,Okay. So i am still not getting a value.,SSI-O
48066,my goal is to make my voltage 3.5.   but I can't get it.  I do not know what the resistor should be.,SSI-O
48067,I got the same goal,SSI-O
48068,"When i first started, I had a voltage reading and I no longer have anything no matter how I adjust the resistance value",SSI-O
48069,it's the same,SSI-O
48070,3.5V,SSI-O
48071,3.5*4=14.   14 is total voltage.,SSI-O
48072,i'm still having the same issue as i said before.,SSI-O
48073,If I keep resistor value aroung 470 ohm,SSI-O
48074,it gives me 1.56v,SSI-O
48075,i got 1.46 at  270 ohms,SSI-O
48076,i got 1.51,SSI-O
48077,390 ohms,SSI-O
48078,"it did that too me too, i just ha to wait alittle",SSI-O
48079,I am getting 1.45 v @390,SSI-O
48080,it keeps changing,SSI-O
48081,but 390+390=780,SSI-O
48082,and Ro is 560,SSI-O
48083,this thing is broken,SSI-O
48084,it doesnt even fully add up to 6 volts,SSI-O
48085,REALLY NOTHING IS WORKIND AT MY END,SSI-O
48086,mine is 4.25 as well,SSI-O
48087,Mine is 4.25 V as well,SSI-O
48088,1.5V needed,SSI-O
48089,My goal is 3.83V,SSI-O
48090,My is 1.02 V,SSI-O
48091,they add up to 6.35V,SSI-O
48092,so the voltage across R0 is 4.65,SSI-O
48093,so the current is just 4.65/680,SSI-O
48094,so mine is 220,SSI-O
48095,mine is 560,SSI-O
48096,Mine is 150,SSI-O
48097,my goal voltage is 4.76V,SSI-O
48098,Mine voltage goal is 3.92 V,SSI-O
48099,mine is 1.05v,SSI-O
48100,so 9.57v total,SSI-O
48101,I got 9.73 V,SSI-O
48102,2.11V at 330ohms,SSI-O
48103,mine is 2.49v at 390 ohms,SSI-O
48104,this will give us e,SSI-O
48105,2.75V,SSI-O
48106,2.75,SSI-O
48107,2.75,SSI-O
48108,11V,SSI-O
48109,so E is 11V,SSI-O
48110,so the current needs to be1.27V/180ohms,SSI-O
48111,so you can solve for your R value,SSI-O
48112,A=.0666,SSI-O
48113,mine would be 150,SSI-O
48114,so current needs to be .007,SSI-O
48115,mines 680,SSI-O
48116,mines 150,SSI-O
48117,I got 560,SSI-O
48118,ok my current values are 560ohms and 1.77V,SSI-O
48119,mine are 470ohms and 1.49V,SSI-O
48120,ok the total current is 14.6A atm,SSI-O
48121,R0=Rt-(R1+R2+R3),SSI-O
48122,V=It+Rt,SSI-O
48123,ok then the R0 is 180ohms,SSI-O
48124,7V 180ohms,SSI-O
48125,mine is 1.64v,SSI-O
48126,3.46,SSI-O
48127,mine is 1.14,SSI-O
48128,so total is 6.24V,SSI-O
48129,My goal is 3V,SSI-O
48130,My goal is also 3V,SSI-O
48131,My goal is 3V as well,SSI-O
48132,which is 560ohms,SSI-O
48133,My goal is 1.97 V,SSI-O
48134,My goal is 2.89V,SSI-O
48135,My goal is .78V,SSI-O
48136,My goal is 10.4V,SSI-O
48137,My goal is 2.29V,SSI-O
48138,My goal is 3.43,SSI-O
48139,My resistor is at 220ohms,SSI-O
48140,My resistor is at 1k ohms,SSI-O
48141,Mine is at 330,SSI-O
48142,The total voltage,SSI-O
48143,So the circuit current is .0127A,SSI-O
48144,And then that current multiplied by R0 is V0,SSI-O
48145,Then E = V0 + V1 + V2 + V3,SSI-O
48146,My goal is 3.49,SSI-O
48147,Lol 4.13,SSI-O
48148,Mine is 2.33,SSI-O
48149,At 560 ohms I am at 4.22,SSI-O
48150,Was,SSI-O
48151,I was just at 4.13,SSI-O
48152,Now I am at 4.13,SSI-O
48153,im at 1.99,SSI-O
48154,need 2.33,SSI-O

48201,My goal is 1.91V,SSI-O
48202,my goal is 2.33V,SSI-O
48203,we would have the total resistance,SSI-O
48204,I have 3.66V,SSI-O
48205,3.66V,SSI-O
48206,"i got that mine should be 290, but that isn't an option.",SSI-O
48207,270 is the closest,SSI-O
48208,"it's set to 270 right now, but the voltage isn't correct",SSI-O
48209,about .003,SSI-O
48210,i got .0106 amps,SSI-O
48211,the voltage drop for R0 is 8.7V,SSI-O
48212,I got .01228 amps,SSI-O
48213,my goal is 1.14V,SSI-O
48214,my goal is 5.15V,SSI-O

48217,1V over a 120Ohm resistor,SSI-O
48218,mines is 3.25V over 390ohm,SSI-O
48219,now it's 3.92V over 470 Ohm,SSI-O
48220,my resistor is at 150 ohms,SSI-O
48221,my is 270 ohm resistor,SSI-O
48222,mine is at 680 ohms,SSI-O
48223,150,SSI-O
48224,the current across the entire circuit is 0.0916666666A,SSI-O
48225,we had that,SSI-O
48226,the formula is R = R1 + R2 + R3,SSI-O
48227,v=ir,SSI-O
48228,mine is 2.64,SSI-O
48229,mine is 2.74,SSI-O

48232,2.62,SSI-O
48233,rn 100,SSI-O
48234,so out total resistance is 120+120+100+whatever mashed has,SSI-O
48235,plus R0,SSI-O
48236,so R0 = 120,SSI-O
48237,mine is 100,SSI-O
48238,okay so our total resistance rn is 440,SSI-O
48239,and thats giving us 3 v,SSI-O
48240,so wait if the totT VOLTAGE IS 11v,SSI-O
48241,and then the first resistance is 120,SSI-O
48242,i = .01966 a,SSI-O
48243,and v=ir,SSI-O
48244,so 3=.01966r,SSI-O
48245,so 153,SSI-O
48246,and we already have 120,SSI-O
48247,33,SSI-O
48248,add up the resistors in series,SSI-O
48249,there,SSI-O
48250,current is the same through each resistor in a series,SSI-O
48251,so total resistance is 2200,SSI-O
48252,thats really high,SSI-O
48253,there,SSI-O
48254,there,SSI-O
48255,im at 150,SSI-O
48256,it isn't goinh to be three numbers that are the exact same,SSI-O
48257,my next lowest is 120,SSI-O
48258,im there now,SSI-O
48259,68 made it dumb,SSI-O
48260,my says 3.01,SSI-O
48261,maine says 1.14,SSI-O
48262,mines at 1,SSI-O
48263,im at 22 rn,SSI-O
48264,56,SSI-O
48265,82,SSI-O
48266,mines at 5.44,SSI-O
48267,270,SSI-O
48268,3.12,SSI-O
48269,DCV 20,SSI-O
48270,im at 470 ohms,SSI-O
48271,im at 100,SSI-O
48272,there,SSI-O
48273,3 volts,SSI-O
48274,It give me 1.92,SSI-O
48275,2.88,SSI-O
48276,3.27,SSI-O
48277,E=R*I,SSI-O
48278,E=12,SSI-O
48279,1.07volts,SSI-O
48280,5.86,SSI-O
48281,I need 1.93 volts,SSI-O
48282,4,SSI-O
48283,E=R*I,SSI-O
48284,E= 16,SSI-O
48285,so I = E/R,SSI-O
48286,16/0.04,SSI-O
48287,400,SSI-O
48288,But I get1.59,SSI-O
48289,i got 180,SSI-O
48290,1.18 currently,SSI-O
48291,I need 1.93,SSI-O
48292,1.07,SSI-O
48293,they were all the same,SSI-O
48294,I have 1.9 now,SSI-O
48295,we set all equal to the resistance of R0,SSI-O
48296,that was it,SSI-O
48297,220 now,SSI-O
48298,back to 180,SSI-O
48299,180,SSI-O
48300,I=V/R,SSI-O
48301,Current stay the same,SSI-O
48302,1.07,SSI-O
48303,1.93,SSI-O
48304,thats your resistance,SSI-O
48305,270,SSI-O
48306,I got 1.97 now,SSI-O
48307,6.42,SSI-O
48308,R0 is 820,SSI-O
48309,So we have 3000 in total,SSI-O
48310,and we can see E,SSI-O
48311,6.42,SSI-O
48312,E=I/R,SSI-O
48313,I have 1.02,SSI-O
48314,4.03,SSI-O

48553,Mine is 0,SSI-O
48554,mine is -0.52,SSI-O
48555,just now went up to 1.98,SSI-O
48556,when i increase the resistance my voltage becomes more negative,SSI-O
48557,im at 10 ohms but my voltage is -0.11,SSI-O
48558,v=1.9,SSI-O
48559,1.8 now,SSI-O
48560,v = -1.81,SSI-O
48561,v = -1.67,SSI-O
48562,v = 0,SSI-O
48563,I am still at zero,SSI-O

48579,It went 2.25,SSI-O
48580,v = 2.7 at 820 ohms,SSI-O
48581,now 2.8],SSI-O
48582,im 1.52 at 330,SSI-O
48583,1.86 at 330 now,SSI-O
48584,2.65 at 470 ohms,SSI-O

48589,2.0 v at 680 ohms,SSI-O
48590,I am 2.75 at 480 ohms,SSI-O
48591,But it is increasing and coming back,SSI-O
48592,ok when i do that it now says -3.99,SSI-O
48593,47,SSI-O
48594,39,SSI-O
48595,68,SSI-O
48596,mine is 11.03,SSI-O
48597,2.66 volts,SSI-O
48598,0.01,SSI-O
48599,to make the voltage 2 volts,SSI-O
48600,"Mine was set E= 8 volts, R0=120 and the goal is 2 volts",SSI-O
48601,I think someone's resistor is not connected,SSI-O
48602,thats what i have i think,SSI-O
48603,but my screen is not showing 2,SSI-O
48604,my voltage is showing 0 so i dont think im getting because the values are getting higher,SSI-O
48605,ok mines only at 560 right now,SSI-O
48606,the multimeter for me is measuring at 0,SSI-O
48607,resistor is 2.2k and multimeter is set at 20k reading 2.20,SSI-O
48608,it is reading 22 for me at 200 k and 1 at 20 k,SSI-O
48609,so we have to be lower than 2,SSI-O
48610,to add up to 2 for all of us together/,SSI-O
48611,i got 002 without decimal places,SSI-O
48612,ok so we cant set the multimeter at 20k or 200k,SSI-O
48613,cuz thts ohms,SSI-O
48614,Im not getting any reading as well,SSI-O
48615,my ohms are set at 10,SSI-O
48616,i think 8.2 M is higher up on the scale maybe going down,SSI-O
48617,and i m getting a reading of 2,SSI-O
48618,i am currently at 10,SSI-O
48619,i ma currently at 2.76,SSI-O
48620,1.99,SSI-O
48621,i have an actual reading,SSI-O
48622,im at 1.99,SSI-O
48623,2.43,SSI-O
48624,0.3,SSI-O
48625,1.82 now,SSI-O
48626,now its 1.90,SSI-O

48718,I thought it was just V=IR but I keep getting weird numbers,SSI-O
48719,1.36/220,SSI-O
48720,we dont know current,SSI-O
48721,my wires are stuck lol,SSI-O
48722,its 11,SSI-O
48723,mine keeps moving,SSI-O
48724,560,SSI-O
48725,560 ohms and 6.36 volts,SSI-O
48726,that just makes it lower,SSI-O
48727,6.5 volts,SSI-O
48728,that makes it go to 7.08 then drops to 6.85,SSI-O
48729,i cant drop anymore without it being like super drastic,SSI-O
48730,IxR is all i know,SSI-O
48731,my resistance is 680 ohms,SSI-O
48732,mine is 180,SSI-O

48741,1.55,SSI-O
48742,im the last circiut,SSI-O
48743,i get 1.75,SSI-O
48744,it reads 1.75,SSI-O
48745,i have mine set at 56 and i get the goal of 0.8,SSI-O
48746,I have mine set at 150 and I get 2.08,SSI-O
48747,1.55 volts,SSI-O
48748,mine is 3.98,SSI-O
48749,that did not do anything for me,SSI-O
48750,okay im at 150,SSI-O
48751,Im at 220,SSI-O
48752,Im still at 220,SSI-O
48753,not anymore,SSI-O
48754,I got 1.55,SSI-O
48755,i got 0.8,SSI-O
48756,I was at 680,SSI-O
48757,im at 120,SSI-O
48758,im at 680,SSI-O
48759,mine goes back and forth,SSI-O
48760,Snow youre on a different voltage setting than us,SSI-O
48761,at 0.95,SSI-O
48762,at 120 ohms,SSI-O
48763,100,SSI-O
48764,82,SSI-O
48765,68,SSI-O
48766,it just keeps dropping,SSI-O
48767,56,SSI-O
48768,im at 470,SSI-O
48769,my goal is 2 volts.,SSI-O
48770,mine is 8,SSI-O
48771,2 v,SSI-O
48772,my goal is 2,SSI-O
48773,180 is the resistance to make the voltage 8v,SSI-O
48774,it's at 180,SSI-O
48775,the current is 1440,SSI-O
48776,because v*r=i,SSI-O
48777,180,SSI-O
48778,180,SSI-O
48779,okay its at 47,SSI-O
48780,my volt is 0.33,SSI-O
48781,i=.044,SSI-O
48782,V=Ir1+ir2+ir3,SSI-O
48783,that gives me 1.67 v,SSI-O
48784,68 gives me 1.96,SSI-O
48785,but as you all move your resistance mine changes as well,SSI-O
48786,so now its 1.58,SSI-O
48787,it is,SSI-O
48788,all the numbers on the resistor should all be the same,SSI-O
48789,"82 right now, but will have to move if we all go to it",SSI-O
48790,"at 120, mine reads 1.91",SSI-O

48802,"so v1=4.57, v2=1.44, v3=6.74",SSI-O
48803,so v0 has to be 1.15,SSI-O
48804,m goal is 6.7 not 6.74,SSI-O
48805,then its 1.19,SSI-O

48951,i cant reach 4.25,SSI-O
48952,mine hasnt changed,SSI-O
48953,the red knob should be on DCV 20,SSI-O
48954,ohh mine is at 4.25,SSI-O
48955,so mine currently reads .28,SSI-O
48956,ok it did,SSI-O
48957,1.33,SSI-O
48958,2 volts,SSI-O
48959,mine is 7.56,SSI-O
48960,mine is at 120,SSI-O

48963,0,SSI-O
48964,resistor,SSI-O
48965,the resistor,SSI-O
48966,k so 470 on the resistor gives me 7.3 on the red knob,SSI-O
48967,i need 7.56,SSI-O
48968,now im at 7.38 on the red knob and my resistor is at 560,SSI-O
48969,im at 1.98 and at 150 on the resistor,SSI-O
48970,1.75 now,SSI-O
48971,1.17 and 100,SSI-O
48972,k currently at 7.9,SSI-O
48973,and 680,SSI-O
48974,2.04 at 180,SSI-O
48975,7.7,SSI-O
48976,20,SSI-O
48977,mine is 3.69,SSI-O
48978,my voltage is 1.41,SSI-O
48979,we have to make our own E,SSI-O
48980,12,SSI-O
48981,umm 15,SSI-O
48982,which is like,SSI-O
48983,E=IR,SSI-O
48984,so 15 then,SSI-O
48985,thats a big number,SSI-O
48986,I get 3690,SSI-O
48987,my goal is 1.75v,SSI-O
48988,until we are right,SSI-O
48989,"I can do that, but the computer itself will not allow me to change it",SSI-O
48990,The Resistor,SSI-O
48991,On the red box calculator it reads 0.42 at 20k,SSI-O
48992,my goal is 0.57v,SSI-O
48993,Mine is 1.88 v,SSI-O
48994,my goal is 4.67 v,SSI-O
48995,so the sum of our three is 7.12,SSI-O
48996,the left is 11-7.12=3.88,SSI-O
48997,3.88/680 will be the current in the circuit,SSI-O
48998,current is 0.0057,SSI-O
48999,R=V/I,SSI-O
49000,mine R is 100,SSI-O

49003,RED is 819.3,SSI-O
49004,blue is 100,SSI-O
49005,I have mine on the right one but my voltage isn't right still,SSI-O
49006,0.57 & 0.61,SSI-O
49007,I'm at 2.03 and need to get to 1.88,SSI-O
49008,I have the nob on 20 DCV as well...it gives me the closest to the correct voltage,SSI-O
49009,my goal is 3.44 volts,SSI-O
49010,my goal is 7.24,SSI-O
49011,2.38v,SSI-O
49012,my R is 560,SSI-O
49013,I got 2.68,SSI-O
49014,2.59 now,SSI-O
49015,2.80 now,SSI-O
49016,2.42,SSI-O
49017,k. now it's 3.58,SSI-O
49018,2.52,SSI-O
49019,3.09,SSI-O
49020,2.61,SSI-O
49021,I'm at 330 and my 3.45v,SSI-O
49022,2.83,SSI-O
49023,Dropped me way down to 2.93,SSI-O
49024,2.06,SSI-O
49025,3.39,SSI-O
49026,1.85,SSI-O
49027,2.21,SSI-O
49028,3.32,SSI-O
49029,it should show a voltage,SSI-O
49030,I dont see anything above,SSI-O
49031,should show E = 18 volts,SSI-O
49032,r0 = 120,SSI-O
49033,your goal,SSI-O
49034,and also said the goal is to make the voltage to 4.5,SSI-O
49035,my resistor is 1.83 volts,SSI-O
49036,two 4.5 volts,SSI-O
49037,mine is 4.5,SSI-O
49038,mine says 4.5,SSI-O
49039,my goal is 4.5,SSI-O
49040,k so all our resistors are the same,SSI-O
49041,r0 is 3.5 volts,SSI-O
49042,4.5 x 3 = 13.5,SSI-O
49043,et = 18,SSI-O
49044,18-13.5 = 3.5,SSI-O
49045,r0=3.5,SSI-O
49046,all our goals are 4.5,SSI-O
49047,3.5/120 ohms,SSI-O
49048,which is .029,SSI-O
49049,18 / .029,SSI-O
49050,617,SSI-O
49051,RT = 617,SSI-O
49052,ok im on 150 ohms',SSI-O
49053,150,SSI-O
49054,okay mines is 4.74,SSI-O
49055,it was 4.5,SSI-O
49056,180 ohms,SSI-O
49057,150 ohms,SSI-O
49058,ok im at 5.14,SSI-O
49059,im on 180 ohms but my meter is saying 5.4,SSI-O
49060,5.14 now,SSI-O
49061,5.68 now,SSI-O
49062,it wnet down to 4.0,SSI-O
49063,and on 120 ohns,SSI-O
49064,im on 120 ohms,SSI-O
49065,was giving me RT of 1.65,SSI-O
49066,okay the goal is 5.6,SSI-O
49067,617,SSI-O
49068,my goal is 1.5,SSI-O
49069,2.7,SSI-O
49070,mines is 5.6 volt,SSI-O
49071,gives us V of R0,SSI-O
49072,I got 120,SSI-O
49073,1.5+2.7+5.6,SSI-O
49074,9.8,SSI-O
49075,9.8,SSI-O
49076,strange number,SSI-O
49077,1.2 =r0,SSI-O
49078,1.2/120,SSI-O
49079,.01 A,SSI-O
49080,IT = .01,SSI-O
49081,RT = 1100 ohms,SSI-O
49082,our 3 will equal 980,SSI-O
49083,their not the same tho,SSI-O
49084,mine R is 270,SSI-O
49085,last two R is 710,SSI-O
49086,ur Resistance is 150,SSI-O
49087,im 1.67v,SSI-O
49088,5.15,SSI-O
49089,2.05,SSI-O
49090,so our 3 = 8.87,SSI-O
49091,we dont know ET or Rv,SSI-O
49092,ET = 10v,SSI-O
49093,so 1.13v is R0,SSI-O
49094,IT= .00753333333,SSI-O
49095,my R is 220,SSI-O
49096,cant move the fuck on,SSI-O
49097,unkown value,SSI-O
49098,need 4.5V,SSI-O
49099,need 4.5v,SSI-O
49100,goal is 4.5v,SSI-O
49101,4.5,SSI-O
49102,so we all have 4.5,SSI-O
49103,Et is 18 Volt,SSI-O
49104,"if we add up all our goal volts, it adds up to 13.5",SSI-O
49105,we subtract 13.5 from 18,SSI-O
49106,and get 4.5,SSI-O
49107,that 4.5 is R0,SSI-O
49108,so every resistor in this circuit has a voltage of 4.5,SSI-O
49109,"since R0 is 1000 Ohms and all our resistors are the same value, all our resistors are 1000 Ohms",SSI-O
49110,goal is 3.73 volts,SSI-O
49111,need .8 volts,SSI-O
49112,1.8,SSI-O
49113,R0 is .66V,SSI-O
49114,current is 6.6 mA,SSI-O
49115,current is .0066 to put in calculator,SSI-O
49116,1.67V,SSI-O
49117,2.38v,SSI-O
49118,1.11v,SSI-O
49119,r0 is 560,SSI-O
49120,Adding them gets 5.16V,SSI-O
49121,i am at 2.75v on mine,SSI-O
49122,1.62,SSI-O
49123,my meter is reading 1.62,SSI-O

49139,Et is 8V,SSI-O
49140,up,SSI-O
49141,im at 3.22,SSI-O
49142,now im scared to touch mine,SSI-O
49143,has to be exact,SSI-O
49144,3.23,SSI-O
49145,mkine is 3.90 ohms,SSI-O
49146,with 1.85 volts,SSI-O
49147,our e total is 8 volts,SSI-O
49148,still cant get exact,SSI-O
49149,goal: 3.25 V,SSI-O
49150,my goal is 3.25,SSI-O
49151,"ok, mine is now 330",SSI-O
49152,r3 = 390. I get 3.21 V,SSI-O
49153,I have 3.09,SSI-O
49154,It just dropped as you said that,SSI-O
49155,mines at 470 now,SSI-O
49156,i also cant use my probes anymore for some reason,SSI-O
49157,I'm at 470 now,SSI-O
49158,I get 3.1 V,SSI-O
49159,4.63,SSI-O
49160,0.83,SSI-O
49161,2.73,SSI-O
49162,I'm r3 and I,SSI-O
49163,I'm r3 and Im 470 at 2.87 V,SSI-O
49164,I'm R1 680,SSI-O
49165,R1/.463 = R2/.083 = R3/.273,SSI-O
49166,2.73*,SSI-O
49167,"aight, I am now at 120, which is 10/.083",SSI-O
49168,"I'm at 22 ohms, which is 10/.463",SSI-O
49169,bear 10/.273,SSI-O
49170,But I'm getting out like .84 v,SSI-O
49171,I should be 2.73,SSI-O
49172,.00822A,SSI-O
49173,mine is 4.63,SSI-O
49174,2.73 V,SSI-O
49175,".83, as he said",SSI-O
49176,mine should be 560,SSI-O
49177,i got 9.867R2 = 1.7689R1 = 3R3,SSI-O
49178,lion should be 100,SSI-O
49179,"aight, my goal is 3.03",SSI-O
49180,4.54,SSI-O
49181,7.71 V,SSI-O
49182,I read 3.33 V. From R3,SSI-O
49183,3.33V,SSI-O
49184,total R= 570,SSI-O
49185,so E = 19 ish,SSI-O
49186,i got 2.46R1 = 4.19R2,SSI-O
49187,R3 = 7.71V / .03333A = ~230,SSI-O
49188,mine should be 220,SSI-O
49189,current should be .0137777777,SSI-O
49190,so 2.5 volts,SSI-O
49191,My voltage goal is 2.5,SSI-O
49192,2.5,SSI-O
49193,120 has me at 2.5,SSI-O
49194,i have 2.01 v,SSI-O
49195,1.39,SSI-O
49196,mines  5.16,SSI-O
49197,8.56 is sum,SSI-O
49198,11 - that,SSI-O
49199,means that 2.44 is voltage across r0,SSI-O
49200,i have a 390 ohm resistor in. i think thats what i need,SSI-O
49201,mines 992 ohms,SSI-O
49202,i'm not getting any volts,SSI-O
49203,through the resistor,SSI-O
49204,didnt make a difference,SSI-O
49205,0,SSI-O
49206,mines at 11,SSI-O
49207,mines working,SSI-O
49208,i need 3.3 volts,SSI-O
49209,i need 2.2,SSI-O
49210,i need 2.7,SSI-O

49222,"680 ohms, so .01 amps",SSI-O
49223,3.45 v,SSI-O
49224,1.57,SSI-O
49225,6.11,SSI-O
49226,now i'm not getting voltage,SSI-O
49227,im getting voltage,SSI-O
49228,3.1,SSI-O
49229,im still not getting voltage,SSI-O
49230,3.1,SSI-O
49231,thats what its at,SSI-O
49232,your thing might just be bugged,SSI-O
49233,mines working now,SSI-O
49234,well we have our volts and ohms,SSI-O
49235,i mean,SSI-O
49236,i need the lowest,SSI-O
49237,kirchof:  E - Ro(.031)  - 3.1 -3.1 - 3.1 = 0,SSI-O
49238,there's only so many,SSI-O
49239,the jump from 68 60 82 leaps it,SSI-O
49240,270,SSI-O
49241,82,SSI-O
49242,i'm at 56,SSI-O
49243,hawk 120,SSI-O
49244,seagull 240,SSI-O
49245,im at 120,SSI-O
49246,2.25 volts,SSI-O
49247,mine's 2.25 volts,SSI-O
49248,2.25,SSI-O
49249,that means that the voltage drop thru R0 = 1.75,SSI-O
49250,so I = .00795454 A,SSI-O
49251,The R came out to be 282.857,SSI-O
49252,"V0 = 2.25, R0 = 220, using Ohms, I found the current",SSI-O
49253,aight my goal is 1.53 volts,SSI-O
49254,I need .85 V,SSI-O
49255,my goal is 5.8,SSI-O
49256,11 volts is the EMF of the battery. I divided that by E0 to get I0 and I is the same for the whole current,SSI-O
49257,aight i think i got mine,SSI-O
49258,i got my R to be 46.36,SSI-O
49259,that's what I was wondering,SSI-O
49260,I got 25.5,SSI-O
49261,so I chose 27 from the list,SSI-O
49262,i chose 47,SSI-O
49263,175.5,SSI-O
49264,okay so 5.8/.033,SSI-O
49265,turns out to be 174 ish but close enough,SSI-O
49266,that was i have selected,SSI-O
49267,check this:,SSI-O
49268,i like double checked everyone's math and got the same answers,SSI-O
49269,so voltage drop across R0 is 2.82 V,SSI-O
49270,I got I = .0085454 A,SSI-O
49271,Yes,SSI-O
49272,okay so E=11 R0=330 and voltage 5.8,SSI-O
49273,aight my resistance turned out to be 179 ohms so i chose 180 ohms,SSI-O
49274,Gucci. mine was 100,SSI-O
49275,I got 678.73 for you red,SSI-O
49276,the voltages thru all the resistors added up make 11 V,SSI-O
49277,V goal = 2.89,SSI-O
49278,goal = .51 V,SSI-O
49279,1.66V,SSI-O
49280,we find it,SSI-O
49281,i wasn't given a current,SSI-O
49282,end up with same current**,SSI-O
49283,I STILL HAVE FLIPIT HW TO DO MAN,SSI-O
49284,u might have a chance. i didnt look online for help as much,SSI-O
49285,"my goal is 1,75",SSI-O
49286,My goal is also 1.75,SSI-O
49287,My R might be 228,SSI-O
49288,Okay 100 now,SSI-O
49289,No current through it,SSI-O
49290,I don't think battery is plugged in,SSI-O
49291,now i see,SSI-O
49292,R is still 100,SSI-O
49293,Current is 1 now,SSI-O
49294,7=I(560+100+r2+R3),SSI-O
49295,It's 1 for me. Amp 2000micro,SSI-O
49296,Ugh mine V is at 1.65,SSI-O

49311,10k,SSI-O
49312,i am at 10000 ohms,SSI-O
49313,V0 = 3.64 so I should be .00774468,SSI-O
49314,".78 person R=100, 3.02 person R= 39",SSI-O
49315,Look 10 = V0 + V1 + V2 + V3,SSI-O
49316,10 = V0 + .78 + 3.02 + 2.56,SSI-O
49317,V0 = 3.64,SSI-O
49318,3.64 / 470 = I,SSI-O

49390,I cant get mine it gets close but not there,SSI-O
49391,our combined is 5.46,SSI-O
49392,lets say v0 is 2.54 which would make E = 8,SSI-O

49434,"at 1k, 2.5 V",SSI-O
49435,before we say we got it,SSI-O
49436,only 1 of us,SSI-O
49437,.64 V,SSI-O
49438,1.45,SSI-O
49439,4.39,SSI-O
49440,we can't do a matrix unfortunately,SSI-O
49441,6.48V total,SSI-O
49442,so 2.52 to Ro,SSI-O
49443,I = .0053617,SSI-O
49444,i'm at 120 ohms,SSI-O
49445,im at 270,SSI-O
49446,voltage,SSI-O
49447,mine says 3.42 V,SSI-O
49448,1.27 volts,SSI-O
49449,im at 820 ohms and 4.19V,SSI-O
49450,820 and 3.37 V,SSI-O
49451,easier to add,SSI-O
49452,100ohms and 1.2V,SSI-O
49453,i'm at 100 ohms at 1.67 V,SSI-O
49454,1.73,SSI-O
49455,1.73,SSI-O
49456,im at 100ohms and 1.73,SSI-O
49457,i need to be at 3.42,SSI-O
49458,Current = 0.0173,SSI-O
49459,we have a 8.996 V battery,SSI-O
49460,"so, let's just call it a 9 V battery",SSI-O
49461,3.42,SSI-O
49462,1.52,SSI-O
49463,6.21 V combined,SSI-O
49464,meaning R0 needs to be 2.8 Volts,SSI-O
49465,Current needs to be .01272727272727 ohms,SSI-O
49466,so then id have 270 ohms,SSI-O
49467,i need the 100 ohm resistor,SSI-O
49468,9,SSI-O
49469,mine is 2.02 V,SSI-O
49470,2.92 V,SSI-O
49471,4.29V,SSI-O
49472,"ok, 9.23 V combined",SSI-O
49473,i have Current = .0208,SSI-O
49474,Voltage / (300 + R0) = .0208,SSI-O
49475,i'm working on the substitution,SSI-O
49476,"so, R0 = 182 ohms",SSI-O
49477,Voltage is 10 Volts,SSI-O
49478,working on finding current,SSI-O
49479,its 180,SSI-O
49480,Current is .011876,SSI-O
49481,ohms,SSI-O
49482,lol youre good i used youre equaiton,SSI-O
49483,0.77 amps,SSI-O
49484,voltage goal for me is 4 V,SSI-O
49485,I have a goal of 4V,SSI-O
49486,my goal is 4 volts and I have a 390 ohm resistor in,SSI-O
49487,or we can do the math if we share our resistances,SSI-O
49488,Im on 220,SSI-O
49489,i have 4 volts,SSI-O
49490,I have 4V,SSI-O
49491,my goal is 5.5,SSI-O
49492,My goal is 4.61,SSI-O
49493,3.24 V,SSI-O
49494,0.009814814814814816=I,SSI-O
49495,I just measured 7.41 Amp,SSI-O
49496,that is what i did,SSI-O
49497,V=IR,SSI-O
49498,So dont we have to report our R's on our resistors,SSI-O
49499,v on r0 is 2.65,SSI-O
49500,2.65/270,SSI-O
49501,this is at the indicated values for v,SSI-O
49502,And then we could find the current using V=IR0,SSI-O
49503,And then since current is the same in series we could all just do V=IR knowing V from the problem and I from that solvr,SSI-O
49504,my r was 330,SSI-O
49505,including R0,SSI-O
49506,to find the r use this 0.009814814814814816               for I then v/i,SSI-O
49507,v=4.68,SSI-O
49508,V=2.13,SSI-O
49509,6.66,SSI-O
49510,at -5.74 V,SSI-O
49511,I got a reading of 16.24,SSI-O
49512,.01624 A,SSI-O
49513,I was just going to do V=IR where I was 16.24 and R was 4R0 since we are all at R0 as our values,SSI-O
49514,my v=4.75,SSI-O
49515,Oh that is faster so that means the E is 4.75*4,SSI-O
49516,So E is 19,SSI-O
49517,goal voltage,SSI-O
49518,I just did the math on (390x4)x0.01624 = 25.334,SSI-O
49519,6.66,SSI-O
49520,Peach you need 330,SSI-O
49521,Plum you need 470,SSI-O
49522,4.68,SSI-O
49523,i need 3.25,SSI-O
49524,3.25 here,SSI-O
49525,I'm already 470,SSI-O
49526,or 820 i guess,SSI-O
49527,giving me 6.49 with 820,SSI-O
49528,i was 820k whoops,SSI-O
49529,from what was left i divided by the r0 to find the current and then divided that by 3.25 and got 820,SSI-O
49530,3.34,SSI-O
49531,2.77,SSI-O
49532,4.83,SSI-O
49533,i think I'm 683,SSI-O
49534,i need 4.97,SSI-O
49535,1.94,SSI-O
49536,I need 1.34,SSI-O
49537,0.85,SSI-O
49538,1.28,SSI-O
49539,5.81,SSI-O
49540,I'm trying,SSI-O
49541,i have no voltage right now,SSI-O
49542,i think thats part of the plan,SSI-O
49543,I was trying to find current but my ameter isn't working,SSI-O
49544,i think its a 9 volt battery,SSI-O
49545,current is 0.007,SSI-O
49546,so 0.007 time 150,SSI-O
49547,plug it in it accepted mine,SSI-O
49548,plus all our volts,SSI-O
49549,okay so now that we know current we can all find our respective resisntaces,SSI-O
49550,pretty sure ive got mine,SSI-O
49551,v0 is .75,SSI-O
49552,voltage at R0,SSI-O
49553,0.75/150,SSI-O
49554,gives current 0.005,SSI-O
49555,i got current to be 0.007...,SSI-O
49556,that was with our orignal values,SSI-O
49557,Mountain should be like 1k,SSI-O
49558,4.84,SSI-O
49559,10,SSI-O
49560,1.24,SSI-O
49561,10.18***,SSI-O
49562,starting at 4.84,SSI-O
49563,with a 330 ohm resistor,SSI-O
49564,2.43 with 180 ohms,SSI-O
49565,im at 9.16 volts with a resistor of 680,SSI-O
49566,V = 4.45 R= 330 I = 0.0135,SSI-O
49567,(16.04 + E) / (1190 + R0) = 0.0135,SSI-O
49568,im at 820 ohms now and 10.05 volts,SSI-O
49569,2.21 V at 180 ohm,SSI-O
49570,V = 4.05 R = 330 A = 0.0123,SSI-O
49571,(16.31 + E) / (1330 + R0) = 0.0123,SSI-O
49572,so i got r0 to be 225 ohms,SSI-O
49573,are we allowed to use paper for this??? i would need paper to do a system,SSI-O
49574,R0 = (E - 0.05)/ 0.123,SSI-O
49575,alright well i got r0 to be 20.83,SSI-O
49576,which makes our voltage a whop[ping 0.305,SSI-O
49577,and my voltage is 19,SSI-O
49578,so we know E is 19 volts,SSI-O
49579,its 220 ohms,SSI-O
49580,19 volts and 220 ohms,SSI-O
49581,I got 0.0125 amps,SSI-O
49582,.0125 sounds better,SSI-O
49583,okay cool 0.0125,SSI-O
49584,our goal is the same,SSI-O
49585,im r1 and im trying to get 3.75,SSI-O
49586,Im R3 and I'm trting to get the same,SSI-O
49587,3.75,SSI-O
49588,Or the voltage,SSI-O
49589,i think we are controlling the resistance,SSI-O
49590,resistance is the only thing I can change,SSI-O
49591,i got 2.2 amps,SSI-O
49592,So thats constant,SSI-O
49593,ok so we know v = 15. and r0 = 680,SSI-O
49594,But that would go up..,SSI-O
49595,"i thought that series circuts, the total resistance is the sum of all the r",SSI-O
49596,15 = (2.2)(680 + R1 + r2 + r3),SSI-O
49597,"So, 15/2.2-680 =3R",SSI-O
49598,i tried micro and the number was to big,SSI-O
49599,i thought current was suppose to be constant haha,SSI-O
49600,well it was 2.2 and now i get 5.4,SSI-O
49601,"I', gettig 1.81",SSI-O
49602,"Ok, my current just changed",SSI-O
49603,and amps is staying the same,SSI-O
49604,But maybe it changes by the resisters before us,SSI-O
49605,R0 is set,SSI-O
49606,"oh shoot, we can calculate r",SSI-O
49607,15 = I 680,SSI-O
49608,But that needs to change for each one too,SSI-O
49609,So 15/680 for the first one,SSI-O
49610,so i across r0 is .022,SSI-O
49611,i need 3.75,SSI-O
49612,so R1 is 160,SSI-O
49613,170,SSI-O
49614,it doesnt have an option for that,SSI-O
49615,after he has set his resister,SSI-O
49616,"They*, I guesss we shouldn't asume",SSI-O
49617,With the multimeter set to 20m and the leads on the green wire,SSI-O
49618,"Alright, the  14.42*R1=.022",SSI-O
49619,That seems crazy small,SSI-O
49620,13.01,SSI-O
49621,with my resistor = 6.8kohms,SSI-O
49622,So I'm meassuring 2.56 volts coming in,SSI-O
49623,So 2.56=.022*R,SSI-O
49624,So mine would be 116,SSI-O
49625,ok i got the popup message,SSI-O
49626,4.5 V here too,SSI-O
49627,4.5 here too,SSI-O
49628,I though R0 was the resistance of the board,SSI-O
49629,Mine is at 39 right now.,SSI-O
49630,im at 82,SSI-O
49631,im at 56 now,SSI-O
49632,Im at 33,SSI-O
49633,i see 4.5 V on my screen,SSI-O
49634,now 4.1 agaon,SSI-O
49635,I have 4.1 too,SSI-O
49636,Im at 2.42,SSI-O
49637,my thing is set to 200 DCV,SSI-O
49638,3.8V here,SSI-O
49639,3.76 V now for me,SSI-O
49640,Mine just went down to 3.5,SSI-O
49641,4.2 here,SSI-O
49642,"Mine was 4.2, now it's 4",SSI-O
49643,im at 56 ohm now,SSI-O
49644,Im at 4.4 rn,SSI-O
49645,Im was at 82 already,SSI-O
49646,im at 82 now and have 4.3V,SSI-O
49647,im at 100 now,SSI-O
49648,4.5 here,SSI-O
49649,Ayy! 4.5,SSI-O
49650,So I need 2.96 Volts,SSI-O
49651,i need 1.98V,SSI-O
49652,Mine is 3.62,SSI-O
49653,im using 180 and im at 2.02V,SSI-O
49654,I'm at 180 and have 2.62,SSI-O
49655,"Ok, so I need 0.56 V",SSI-O
49656,i need 0.67V,SSI-O
49657,I need 2.18,SSI-O
49658,R2,SSI-O
49659,im R1 and im sitting at 82 ohm,SSI-O
49660,R3 at 150 ohm and .83V,SSI-O
49661,R2 sitting at 390 ohm and 2.14 V,SSI-O
49662,now im sitting at 100 ohm and at 0.55V,SSI-O
49663,R1 at 150 ohm and 0.75V,SSI-O
49664,150 ohm and .75v,SSI-O
49665,Im at 470 and 2.36 ohm,SSI-O
49666,i thought E=V(r0)+V(r1)+...,SSI-O
49667,I was trying to find the current,SSI-O
49668,I think it is 7.02,SSI-O
49669,Mine is 7.98,SSI-O
49670,R1 at 120 ohm and 0.68 V (need 0.67V),SSI-O
49671,I was at 2.21 and I need 2.18,SSI-O
49672,im at 8 current if that means anything,SSI-O
49673,im at 0.69V now,SSI-O
49674,anything i change goes up by alot,SSI-O
49675,"Awesome, Now eagle can go",SSI-O
49676,im at 120,SSI-O
49677,68 Ohms here,SSI-O
49678,im at 100 now,SSI-O
49679,Oh dang im at 330,SSI-O
49680,i feel like eagle has the most space to change,SSI-O
49681,Im 390,SSI-O
49682,R1 120,SSI-O
49683,I'm at 100,SSI-O
49684,I need 3.5V,SSI-O
49685,i need 3.5 V too,SSI-O
49686,3.5 is what i need as well,SSI-O
49687,I have 3.45 rn,SSI-O
49688,i got 3.5 too,SSI-O
49689,2.36V,SSI-O
49690,mine is 1.33 now,SSI-O
49691,0.91,SSI-O
49692,that means R0 has 3.4V,SSI-O
49693,I = 0.006,SSI-O
49694,ive got 1.33,SSI-O
49695,0.89V,SSI-O
49696,my goal is 4.99,SSI-O
49697,2.94,SSI-O
49698,when i remove one end of the green wire and test it it says 13.00V,SSI-O
49699,I have 0 currently,SSI-O
49700,v1+v2+v3 = 8.82,SSI-O
49701,i got 7.47A,SSI-O
49702,mine is at 0 again,SSI-O
49703,i think mine says 5.7A,SSI-O
49704,mine says 5.08,SSI-O
49705,mine is at 0 right now,SSI-O
49706,or else the multimeter will be in parallel with the resistor,SSI-O
49707,mine keeps flashing 5.44 for a second but then it goes back to 0,SSI-O
49708,my voltage drop is 5.73V,SSI-O
49709,so 4.18V drops at R0,SSI-O
49710,Im at 1k ohms with 4.96V,SSI-O
49711,mine is at 636Ohm at 0.009A and 5.73V,SSI-O
49712,i think the person who needs .89 needs a 100 ohm and the person who needs a 4.99 needs a 560 ohm,SSI-O
49713,problem is that you cannot change the resistance,SSI-O
49714,at 560 ohm i have 3.34V,SSI-O
49715,at 636Ohm i got 5.73V,SSI-O
49716,to get 0.89V i need to reduce the current down to,SSI-O
49717,0.0014Amp,SSI-O
49718,so V0 = 0.657V,SSI-O
49719,thats weird. i can change mine too,SSI-O
49720,maybe yours is locked for this part,SSI-O
49721,grey red brown gold,SSI-O
49722,youre 820 ohms,SSI-O
49723,so I=0.00109,SSI-O
49724,so I = 0.005,SSI-O
49725,cuz my V1 is 4.07V,SSI-O
49726,i lied dont listen to me,SSI-O
49727,when i did 2.94/0.005 i got 588,SSI-O
49728,so the closest is 560,SSI-O
49729,V0= 2.35V,SSI-O
49730,i should be around 1k ohms,SSI-O
49731,i think something might be wrong with greens that it cant change cause i dont see a way this can work with green at 820,SSI-O
49732,so we is the situation,SSI-O
49733,"my resistance is set. therefore, my voltage drop is set",SSI-O
49734,current is constant,SSI-O
49735,so that mine drop to 0.89V,SSI-O
49736,My goal is to get 2.5 volts. I'm assuming that means voltage drop.,SSI-O
49737,Hello team I have a goal of 2.5 volts,SSI-O
49738,mine is 2.5 as well,SSI-O
49739,Mine is 330 ohms with a drop of 2.95 volts,SSI-O
49740,"So, the sum of the voltage drops is equal to the source voltage. 3x2.5 equals 7.5. 10-7.5 equals a 2.5 voltage drop on R0. So, all resistor values should be the same then",SSI-O
49741,"Okay, my goal this time is to make my voltage drop 0.62 volts",SSI-O
49742,My goal is 5.19 volts,SSI-O
49743,my goal is 078 v,SSI-O
49744,I got 5.22 mA,SSI-O
49745,"Okay, this is going to be harder now. I have a volt drop of 4.1 v",SSI-O
49746,my voltage drop is .87 v,SSI-O
49747,My goal is 4.88 volts,SSI-O
49748,My multimeter isn't working or is actually reading 0. Presently my R is 150 ohms,SSI-O
49749,1.82 volts,SSI-O
49750,my voltage has a zero reading,SSI-O
49751,my resistor is at 68 ohms and i have a voltage drop of .85,SSI-O
49752,my goal is .87,SSI-O
49753,I have a 144 ohm resistor on my board,SSI-O
49754,"E=14, R0=560, R1=55",SSI-O
49755,rs=144,SSI-O
49756,You have to measure it with the meter.,SSI-O
49757,R2= 54.4,SSI-O
49758,E=14 v,SSI-O
49759,so my new resistor value is 56 ohms,SSI-O
49760,e=14 v R0= 560 ohms R3=56 Ohms,SSI-O
49761,Mine is still 55,SSI-O
49762,Vdrop1=9.638,SSI-O
49763,i have a voltage drop of 2.28 v,SSI-O
49764,my current is 12.39 A,SSI-O
49765,Lol I have 10.4mA,SSI-O
49766,ocean i can see your circuit,SSI-O
49767,my resistance went back to 144,SSI-O
49768,my voltage drop went back to 2.28v,SSI-O
49769,"In the real world, breaking the circuit shouldn't change resistance of a resitor",SSI-O
49770,my voltage drop (180 ohm resistor) is 1.87,SSI-O
49771,so I found out we can change our resistor values,SSI-O
49772,we can change it to what we need to get our volatage 3.5v,SSI-O
49773,157 ohm,SSI-O
49774,"Currently, R1=72.6",SSI-O
49775,R2 = 137.7,SSI-O
49776,so R0 has a volt drop of .025 v,SSI-O
49777,becuase 14v/560 is .025,SSI-O
49778,becuase 14v/4 =3.5v,SSI-O
49779,ok. I'm 560 ohms now,SSI-O
49780,i am at 560 ohm as well,SSI-O
49781,1.5V,SSI-O
49782,Mine is 1.5V,SSI-O
49783,1.5v mine,SSI-O
49784,Mine is at 270,SSI-O
49785,4.07 v,SSI-O
49786,0.6V,SSI-O
49787,8.02V TOTAL,SSI-O
49788,That means that R0 goal voltage is 5.98V.,SSI-O
49789,i chose 1K and gave me 5.45v,SSI-O
49790,now i have 4.03v,SSI-O
49791,V/R0 to have the current,SSI-O
49792,then V/A to have the right resistor,SSI-O

49801,i am good to go,SSI-O
49802,220,SSI-O
49803,my goal is 0.5 volts,SSI-O
49804,my goal is .9 volts,SSI-O
49805,2.73,SSI-O
49806,R3,SSI-O
49807,220 but my goal is 0.5 volts,SSI-O
49808,I got 1.2k ohms,SSI-O
49809,560 ohns,SSI-O
49810,R0= 560ohms,SSI-O
49811,mine says get it to 1.99,SSI-O
49812,mine say 6.24,SSI-O
49813,i thought we were all supposed to work on the same one and help each other,SSI-O
49814,i can only get 2.44,SSI-O
49815,3.95,SSI-O
49816,220,SSI-O
49817,180,SSI-O
49818,330,SSI-O
49819,now change back to 270,SSI-O
49820,i thought that would give us that unknown voltage,SSI-O
49821,I can't get back to the 5.94V it wants me to have,SSI-O
49822,5.94,SSI-O
49823,3.24,SSI-O
49824,My goal voltage just changed to 3.75,SSI-O
49825,im at 3.75,SSI-O
49826,Okay mine says 3.75 too,SSI-O
49827,that was fast,SSI-O
49828,next,SSI-O
49829,One of y'all go up 1 resistor,SSI-O

49848,I got 0,SSI-O
49849,I still got 6.8,SSI-O
49850,And i need 5.71,SSI-O
49851,2.75,SSI-O
49852,ok cool. According to the voltage equation the ratio of (R/RT) needs to be 1/4,SSI-O
49853,2.75=11(R/RT),SSI-O
49854,from that ^,SSI-O
49855,0.25,SSI-O
49856,"1/4, got it",SSI-O
49857,"we control r1, 2 and 3",SSI-O
49858,so that means the leftover 2.75 has to be dropping over R0 as well,SSI-O

50009,with a 180 resistor,SSI-O
50010,mine is 0.77,SSI-O
50011,i took 2 and divided it by 0.024 to get the resistance value for a resistor and got 83.33,SSI-O
50012,There is also a 4th resistor R0 that is at 330 that,SSI-O
50013,"I set the resistor to 82, closest to 83.3 and I'm at 1.14 v",SSI-O

50057,pluse the drop on 1000,SSI-O
50058,12mA is mine,SSI-O
50059,50.6 ohms * 10.95 MA =,SSI-O
50060,all added up,SSI-O
50061,my part of E is 554.069 v i believe,SSI-O
50062,times amps,SSI-O
50063,1320 times .01095,SSI-O
50064,100,SSI-O
50065,my resistor is 120,SSI-O
50066,150 ohm,SSI-O
50067,15,SSI-O
50068,my target voltage is 2.5 V,SSI-O
50069,my target voltage is 2.5 V,SSI-O
50070,"my target is also 2.5 volts, after circuit 1",SSI-O
50071,10 / 4 is 2.5,SSI-O
50072,"so its lion, then bear, then tiger",SSI-O
50073,we have 8 total,SSI-O
50074,4 resistors in circuit,SSI-O
50075,Im ready to,SSI-O
50076,my target voltage is 0.83,SSI-O
50077,my target is 5.64 volts,SSI-O
50078,my target voltage is 3.85,SSI-O
50079,i got 12.9 Amps,SSI-O
50080,my circuit reads 0 volts,SSI-O
50081,thats a big difference,SSI-O
50082,20 vdc,SSI-O
50083,14.5 amps,SSI-O
50084,ok,SSI-O
50085,if you do it will change the current,SSI-O
50086,theoretically we should all have the same current,SSI-O
50087,its saying 0 now,SSI-O
50088,im still at 14.5,SSI-O
50089,it said 12.1 for a second but then it went away,SSI-O
50090,wait bear is before lion right,SSI-O
50091,1. Lion,SSI-O
50092,I think im circuit one,SSI-O
50093,2. Bear,SSI-O
50094,3. Tiger,SSI-O
50095,We would have to know total current first though,SSI-O
50096,im at 3.99 volts right now,SSI-O
50097,im at 1.81,SSI-O
50098,11volts/100 = .11amps for the R0,SSI-O
50099,my voltage is 1.45,SSI-O
50100,V at r0 = 11 - each of our measured voltage,SSI-O
50101,so its voltage is .68,SSI-O
50102,now it is 3.99,SSI-O
50103,mine is at 3.99 volts,SSI-O
50104,11-5.64-3.85=1.51,SSI-O
50105,but theres also the .83,SSI-O
50106,ok so r0 is 100ohms and my resistance (currently) is 150 ohm,SSI-O
50107,my resistance is 330,SSI-O
50108,I think my resistance needs to be 560ohms which puts me at 3.99 volts,SSI-O
50109,560 + 100 + 330 + 150 = 1140,SSI-O
50110,1140 total circuit resistance,SSI-O
50111,now 11/1140 = 0.00965 A,SSI-O
50112,11-.965=10.035,SSI-O
50113,my foal voltage is 3.85,SSI-O
50114,ok so V=RI,SSI-O
50115,so we can rearrange that to R = V/I,SSI-O
50116,so the I we are using doesnt work for subsequent calculations,SSI-O
50117,and then the current ends up being  .0068,SSI-O
50118,current only changes if the total resistance changes,SSI-O
50119,V=I*R,SSI-O
50120,"to find voltage drop over R0, multiply I*100 ohms",SSI-O

50161,"we are looking at R0=3.3V, Rhawk= 6.71v, Rseagull= 3.14v, and reagle= 1.43",SSI-O
50162,that put me at 7.06V,SSI-O

50247,we can do the calculation easily if we know total resistance,SSI-O
50248,im at .22,SSI-O
50249,then e = 3.3 volts,SSI-O
50250,we are missing the voltage on R0,SSI-O
50251,0.022 A,SSI-O
50252,mines .75 im at 10,SSI-O

50270,I have c3,SSI-O
50271,"I can't reach 1.75 volts, the 2 resistor values that are the closest end up being above and below 1.75",SSI-O
50272,mine is currently set at 330,SSI-O
50273,270 gives me 1.58,SSI-O
50274,330 gives me 1.93,SSI-O
50275,okay im at 1.57 now at 270 ohms,SSI-O
50276,im at 1.66 at 270 now,SSI-O
50277,at 270,SSI-O
50278,my goal is 1.18 V,SSI-O
50279,mine is 2.17,SSI-O
50280,1.78 v fo rme,SSI-O
50281,I am,SSI-O
50282,I kept my same circit so I am still 3,SSI-O
50283,starting things off looks like my R is 270 and at 2.44 vs,SSI-O
50284,"or was at 244, now 2.52",SSI-O
50285,I need to get 2.17V Im at 2.05 with 220 for R,SSI-O
50286,at 1.15,SSI-O
50287,droped to 220 for r,SSI-O
50288,2.12,SSI-O
50289,1.78 v,SSI-O
50290,My goal is 1.83V,SSI-O
50291,Goal: 10.18 v,SSI-O
50292,"at 820 for r, and the v keeps shifting",SSI-O
50293,ok at 9.17v,SSI-O
50294,Im at 1.68,SSI-O
50295,Im at 1.81,SSI-O
50296,at 9.89,SSI-O
50297,Im at 1.81 need to be at 1.83,SSI-O
50298,Im down to 1.6,SSI-O
50299,at 10.69 need to be at 10.18,SSI-O
50300,at  1.55 need to be 1.83,SSI-O
50301,"at 10.37, needs to be at 10.18",SSI-O
50302,mine is 2.75,SSI-O
50303,10.18,SSI-O
50304,Mines 1.83,SSI-O
50305,so far 14.76 but we also dont know voltage across R0,SSI-O
50306,R0 is 220,SSI-O
50307,Thats the resistance 220 ohms,SSI-O
50308,the R0 is listed in know info,SSI-O
50309,Mine is 180,SSI-O
50310,so my r is 1000,SSI-O
50311,mine is 270 ohms,SSI-O
50312,1670 ohms total,SSI-O
50313,I(1670) = 14.76V + I(220ohms),SSI-O
50314,the total voltage is equal to the total resistance (1670) times current (I),SSI-O
50315,So we solve for I and then take I times Rt (total resistance),SSI-O
50316,v/r=i,SSI-O
50317,someone unplugged a wire im getting 0 volts now,SSI-O
50318,it seems to happen sometimes I noticed that earlier,SSI-O
50319,It's telling me that it isnt,SSI-O
50320,it didnt seem to like it,SSI-O
50321,1670,SSI-O
50322,180,SSI-O
50323,1000,SSI-O
50324,270; and R0 is 220,SSI-O
50325,180+1000+270+220=1670 ohms,SSI-O
50326,my voltage drop is 2.75 V,SSI-O
50327,1.83V,SSI-O
50328,10.18,SSI-O
50329,2.75+1.83+10.18= 14.76 V for know voltage drops,SSI-O
50330,then our total voltage drop would be 14.76 V + voltage drop across R0,SSI-O
50331,Voltage drop across R0 = current (I) x 220 ohms,SSI-O
50332,and it didnt work,SSI-O
50333,it worked for me,SSI-O
50334,my goal is 3.18 V,SSI-O
50335,My goal is 2.6V,SSI-O
50336,my goal is 1.44 V,SSI-O
50337,im at 1.49,SSI-O
50338,I started at 4.83,SSI-O
50339,Im at 1.86,SSI-O
50340,at 180 ohms im at 2.74V,SSI-O
50341,3.02 V; R = 220,SSI-O
50342,"at 2.06, need to be at 1.44, R of currently 150 ohms",SSI-O
50343,180 ohms,SSI-O
50344,220,SSI-O
50345,100ohms,SSI-O
50346,okay so Rt = 180 + 220 + 100 + R0,SSI-O
50347,Mine is 2.5,SSI-O
50348,goal voltage,SSI-O
50349,i have 2.5,SSI-O
50350,goal is 2.5. I assume its the same for all of us,SSI-O
50351,reading 2.71 across r1,SSI-O
50352,i currently have 2.71v,SSI-O
50353,mine is 680,SSI-O
50354,"ro is 680, and r1 is 560",SSI-O
50355,mine is 4.9,SSI-O
50356,0.86,SSI-O
50357,mine is 4.03,SSI-O
50358,at least one person is not connected,SSI-O
50359,ive got a voltage,SSI-O
50360,im reading 3.05v,SSI-O
50361,im at 1.11,SSI-O
50362,ive got r1,SSI-O
50363,"I cant, best i can do is .83, need .86",SSI-O
50364,it will change everytime we change ours,SSI-O
50365,our goal voltage total is 9.79v.,SSI-O
50366,R0 is 42.4 percent of the consumption,SSI-O
50367,that makes mine 8.78%,SSI-O
50368,i am 23.7%,SSI-O
50369,Im 28.8,SSI-O
50370,total,SSI-O
50371,circle is 120 ohm,SSI-O
50372,my goal voltage is 2.91,SSI-O
50373,1.17,SSI-O
50374,"goal is 1.38, reading .73 now",SSI-O
50375,im currently reading 2.3,SSI-O
50376,im reading 1.08,SSI-O
50377,im showing 5.3 amps,SSI-O
50378,now i have no amps,SSI-O
50379,Im reading 4.89 a right now.,SSI-O
50380,"k, im back to 5.33",SSI-O
50381,im at 1.17 and my goal is 1.17,SSI-O
50382,im at 1.43 and goal is 1.38,SSI-O
50383,im at 2.04 with a goal of 2.91,SSI-O
50384,now i read 2.33,SSI-O
50385,3.54,SSI-O
50386,mine is 5.23,SSI-O
50387,820 ohm,SSI-O
50388,i think  amps is .0035,SSI-O
50389,"390, 1.36v",SSI-O
50390,circuit resistance is 2540,SSI-O
50391,8.89v,SSI-O
50392,our current was the same v/r= 0.0035,SSI-O
50393,9v,SSI-O
50394,"Tweet tweet, I need 3.5 volts now. (?ÿƒ?? ?????ÿƒ??)",SSI-O
50395,I also need 3.5 V,SSI-O
50396,"Assuming Eagle needs 3.5V as well, that leaves 3.5V on R0.",SSI-O
50397,"Ok, I need 2.29V now.",SSI-O
50398,I need 2.74V now,SSI-O
50399,Okay so now I need 5.94 V,SSI-O
50400,5.03V left for R0,SSI-O
50401,Got my voltage (?ÿƒ?? ?????ÿƒ??),SSI-O
50402,i got mine to be 180,SSI-O
50403,I need 4.73V,SSI-O
50404,I need 1.01 V,SSI-O
50405,i need 5.74V,SSI-O
50406,ok well mine are in,SSI-O
50407,mine are in,SSI-O
50408,I have current now,SSI-O
50409,Mine's still not showing current,SSI-O
50410,my goal is 2.25 volts,SSI-O
50411,i can only get to 2.29 tho,SSI-O
50412,2.25,SSI-O
50413,mine is showing no voltage now..,SSI-O
50414,"black on right side, red on left side",SSI-O
50415,either side of the resistor,SSI-O
50416,everyone has to have a connected circuit for us to complete it,SSI-O
50417,my goal is 1.27,SSI-O
50418,and now it dropped to 6.90,SSI-O
50419,the little window to change the resistance isn't popping up,SSI-O
50420,so probably 680 is your best bet,SSI-O
50421,680 ohms and I'm at 7.22 volts instead of 7.23,SSI-O
50422,it will settle at your target number,SSI-O
50423,now its at 7.32,SSI-O
50424,and just dropped back to 7.22,SSI-O
50425,i have. tis steady at 7.22,SSI-O
50426,4.99 v,SSI-O
50427,my goal is 4.99v,SSI-O
50428,Goal: 1.27 I'm at 1.28,SSI-O
50429,im at 1.08,SSI-O
50430,my circuit voltage just jumped,SSI-O
50431,680 ohms is too high for me now,SSI-O
50432,mine was at 470 ohms and it was dead on,SSI-O
50433,Baack at 120 Ohms with a 1.28 V,SSI-O
50434,my target is 1.27,SSI-O
50435,7.23,SSI-O
50436,me,SSI-O
50437,R2 (me) should be 950 ohms,SSI-O
50438,and R3 should be 650 ohms or so,SSI-O
50439,"y, my voltage is 5.43 instead of 4.99 now",SSI-O
50440,Goal voltage: 2.5,SSI-O
50441,i need 2.5V,SSI-O
50442,10V and 390ohm,SSI-O
50443,mine is still 1.65,SSI-O
50444,oh rigghhhtt...it changes when everybody changes theirs...forgot about that,SSI-O
50445,the number on the meter,SSI-O
50446,I've got 7.52 mA here also,SSI-O
50447,"I can either get 2.29 or 2.6, I can't get 2.5 currently",SSI-O
50448,its because everybody has to change theres yeag,SSI-O
50449,im getting 6.94 mA,SSI-O
50450,mine just says 0.00 for everything right now.,SSI-O
50451,someone has it disconnected then,SSI-O
50452,I got 6.94mA now,SSI-O
50453,im still at 00,SSI-O
50454,i got 9.52 mA,SSI-O
50455,im good with 7.25 mA,SSI-O
50456,mine still says 0,SSI-O
50457,It will change when our resistances change,SSI-O
50458,so we can measure it to be 2.5 volts out,SSI-O
50459,I'm still measuring 0V,SSI-O
50460,im at 2.39V,SSI-O
50461,mine says 2.39,SSI-O
50462,330,SSI-O
50463,330 ohm,SSI-O
50464,I'm at 330,SSI-O
50465,2.18 V,SSI-O
50466,8.08 volts,SSI-O
50467,now i need 1.21V,SSI-O
50468,E=16 R0=560 ohms,SSI-O
50469,"E= 16,  R0=560",SSI-O
50470,16 V supply and 560 ohm resist,SSI-O
50471,"its 9.52mA rn, but that will change if resistance changes",SSI-O
50472,closest I can get is 1.19V,SSI-O
50473,I'm at 120 ohms,SSI-O
50474,1.3k not an option on mine,SSI-O
50475,now I'm up at 6.8V,SSI-O
50476,everybody should have some range ... some range that gets it near your desired voltage....,SSI-O
50477,Oh i forgot about R0,SSI-O
50478,im ay .99 V,SSI-O
50479,Fulmer showed us how to do this if the Resistances were multiples of each other,SSI-O
50480,but our desired V  values are not multiples of each other,SSI-O
50481,i got 4.53,SSI-O
50482,I got about 150 ohms,SSI-O
50483,i got 270 ohms,SSI-O
50484,My goal is 3.5 V,SSI-O
50485,Goal is 3.5V.,SSI-O
50486,im reading 1.30 ow,SSI-O
50487,mine went up to 5.11 V now,SSI-O
50488,270 ohms,SSI-O
50489,im on 180,SSI-O
50490,180,SSI-O
50491,that put me at 3.65 V,SSI-O
50492,reading 3.45V,SSI-O
50493,mine is on 220 now,SSI-O
50494,Im at 4V with 220Ohms,SSI-O
50495,im there,SSI-O
50496,reading 3.07,SSI-O
50497,4.61,SSI-O
50498,3.76 here,SSI-O
50499,at 3.13 V now,SSI-O
50500,that was so simple holy shit,SSI-O
50501,goal is 0.6 V,SSI-O
50502,my goal is 1.35,SSI-O
50503,1.65V here.,SSI-O
50504,i am,SSI-O
50505,im R1,SSI-O
50506,R2 i guess,SSI-O
50507,Im R2,SSI-O
50508,R3 - like I said.,SSI-O
50509,mine is reading 0V rn,SSI-O
50510,Im at 1.05V,SSI-O
50511,im at 2.67,SSI-O
50512,at 0.62,SSI-O
50513,R2-120 ohms,SSI-O
50514,im at 270 ohm,SSI-O
50515,330,SSI-O
50516,goal is 0.95 V,SSI-O
50517,now my method wont work...lol,SSI-O
50518,my goal is 3.08,SSI-O
50519,Goal is 2.61V,SSI-O
50520,I'm at R3,SSI-O
50521,"i got 12 V, sorry. ill quit",SSI-O
50522,its a 12 V battery bc i do not h ave any voltage now that youre on 12 V,SSI-O
50523,R2 is 120,SSI-O
50524,there,SSI-O
50525,r3 330,SSI-O
50526,"haha, by ratios of R0 and its voltage drop",SSI-O
50527,worked last time,SSI-O
50528,i got 175 hold up,SSI-O
50529,3.08,SSI-O
50530,1.27,SSI-O
50531,need 0.95,SSI-O
50532,1.27 V,SSI-O
50533,that is V/R to get I,SSI-O
50534,my goal is 3.75 volts,SSI-O
50535,my resistance is currently 150,SSI-O
50536,So we have the current through the circuit 0.0375 A,SSI-O
50537,i cant measure anything because one of my probes are hiden,SSI-O
50538,the current is 0.0375 A,SSI-O
50539,the voltage drop is same t the resistance has to be the same,SSI-O
50540,"V = I*R, V=3.75 and I = 0.0375",SSI-O
50541,So all the resistances has to be 100 ohms,SSI-O
50542,5.29 volts for me,SSI-O
50543,Goal: 7.65,SSI-O
50544,3.71 Volts,SSI-O
50545,So I got current through the circuit of 0.01125 A,SSI-O
50546,my goal is 4.91,SSI-O
50547,3.27V,SSI-O
50548,3.93 for me,SSI-O
50549,i got 0.01353 A,SSI-O
50550,My goal is 3.75 v,SSI-O
50551,So my target voltage is 3.75V,SSI-O
50552,So that leaves 3.75 volts for R0,SSI-O
50553,Mine is set,SSI-O
50554,We each control one resistro,SSI-O
50555,I have r3,SSI-O
50556,I'm R2,SSI-O
50557,set,SSI-O
50558,my goal is 6v,SSI-O
50559,Looks like my target is 3.27V,SSI-O
50560,1.82,SSI-O
50561,It should be 4.87,SSI-O
50562,4.87 + 1.86 + 3.76 + 6,SSI-O
50563,16.49,SSI-O
50564,it had a weird sextilionth place digit or something,SSI-O
50565,it's that ugly decimal number,SSI-O
50566,im at 330ohms,SSI-O
50567,0.018185,SSI-O
50568,Thats the current,SSI-O
50569,100,SSI-O
50570,im not at my target either,SSI-O
50571,my goal is 2.02v,SSI-O
50572,1.35,SSI-O
50573,mine is 9.17,SSI-O
50574,330 ohlms,SSI-O
50575,mine reads -1.48,SSI-O
50576,mine is out,SSI-O
50577,Those connect us to the battery,SSI-O
50578,so 17v,SSI-O
50579,If you 'view all circuits' it shows us all connected,SSI-O
50580,Then that leaves 4.46V for R0,SSI-O
50581,So the current is about .013,SSI-O
50582,0.013515152,SSI-O
50583,My resistance looks to be about 680 ohms,SSI-O
50584,im at 149.46,SSI-O
50585,V=IR,SSI-O
50586,mine are,SSI-O
50587,so 1.35=0.1351*R,SSI-O
50588,102.6..,SSI-O
50589,they should be in,SSI-O
50590,the resistor is connected on both sides,SSI-O
50591,Your top two wires look to be disconnected,SSI-O
50592,Those need to be connected,SSI-O
50593,that's important,SSI-O
50594,I have a goal voltage of 2.25V,SSI-O
50595,R2 = 423 ohm,SSI-O
50596,I have 2.25V now,SSI-O
50597,great alright the target voltage is 6.95V for me,SSI-O
50598,1.86V,SSI-O
50599,I am at 6.58 right not,SSI-O
50600,The target voltage is 3.35 V for me.,SSI-O
50601,target is 2.81V,SSI-O
50602,Mine should be 150 ohms and I'm at 1.45V,SSI-O
50603,correct now,SSI-O
50604,target 4.22V,SSI-O
50605,I think im just 180,SSI-O
50606,6.09V,SSI-O
50607,He said to give it a little bit more time>,SSI-O
50608,I can only get it to 2.65 though,SSI-O
50609,or 2.27,SSI-O
50610,hey all my goal is to make my voltage 2.5V,SSI-O
50611,1.72,SSI-O
50612,my goal is 5.31 volts,SSI-O
50613,6.4,SSI-O
50614,13.43 total,SSI-O
50615,.0485 current,SSI-O
50616,but i only have 33,SSI-O
50617,this is when im at 120,SSI-O
50618,im at 270,SSI-O
50619,im at 150,SSI-O
50620,im at 120 now,SSI-O
50621,if you divide 16 by 330 it gives .0485,SSI-O
50622,if i use 0.0086 for the current i get 620 for the resistance,SSI-O
50623,okay so if .0086 is the current,SSI-O
50624,16- (1.72+6.4+5.31),SSI-O
50625,wait lol i got 0.00778 for the current i,SSI-O
50626,im at 680,SSI-O
50627,i got 1.72,SSI-O
50628,im at 820 ohms,SSI-O
50629,9.48,SSI-O
50630,i see 0,SSI-O
50631,3.76,SSI-O
50632,2.09,SSI-O
50633,4.25,SSI-O
50634,I think I'm supposed to have current though,SSI-O
50635,4.25 times 3,SSI-O
50636,because theres no more current to reach you,SSI-O
50637,so it was not connected to the voltmeter,SSI-O
50638,current is meant to be the same for all resistors in series,SSI-O
50639,it says 4.25 now :),SSI-O
50640,thats what out machines say,SSI-O
50641,4*4.25,SSI-O
50642,.0354 is the current,SSI-O
50643,and i got 1.67,SSI-O
50644,if the total voltage is 17,SSI-O
50645,and we have 4 resistors with 120 ohms,SSI-O
50646,i got 1.67/120 is 0.01391 for the current,SSI-O
50647,1.11 volts,SSI-O
50648,2.62,SSI-O
50649,7.38,SSI-O
50650,2.62,SSI-O
50651,1.62,SSI-O
50652,im set to 100 ohms,SSI-O
50653,now it 0,SSI-O
50654,and im at 11 volts with that,SSI-O
50655,i was at 2.62 now at zero,SSI-O
50656,11 now,SSI-O
50657,im down to 0,SSI-O
50658,im connecte dto the green wires right now,SSI-O
50659,im still at zero,SSI-O
50660,2.62,SSI-O
50661,im also still at zero,SSI-O
50662,okay so is the voltage 11,SSI-O
50663,im connected to the resistor,SSI-O
50664,11 was the value when u connected the probes onto the green wire,SSI-O
50665,im 1t 100,SSI-O
50666,ok so r0 = 120 ohms,SSI-O
50667,because 11-(2.62+2.62+2.62) = 3.139,SSI-O
50668,0.09178,SSI-O
50669,i got 80 ohms for the resistane,SSI-O
50670,feels way too low tho,SSI-O
50671,thats 11/120,SSI-O
50672,im at 18,SSI-O
50673,Alright i've got 4 volts,SSI-O
50674,ok so R0 has a voltage drop of 4 as well,SSI-O
50675,mines at 4.19,SSI-O
50676,volts,SSI-O
50677,alright i'm reading 4,SSI-O
50678,now ive got 4,SSI-O
50679,220 for me,SSI-O
50680,I need 2.03V,SSI-O
50681,I need 2.9 V,SSI-O
50682,i need 3.45,SSI-O
50683,ok so voltage drop across R0 is about 0.63 then,SSI-O
50684,well V=IR,SSI-O
50685,so then V/R=I,SSI-O
50686,so that leaves 0.62 for v1,SSI-O
50687,so 0.62/100 = Current,SSI-O
50688,so 6.2 milliamps,SSI-O
50689,alright i think i need 327 ohm,SSI-O
50690,im at 560 about,SSI-O
50691,i need 4.44,SSI-O
50692,I need my voltage to be 5.35 V,SSI-O
50693,mine is 2.5,SSI-O
50694,E is voltage,SSI-O
50695,E is voltage drop across the entire circuit,SSI-O
50696,i'm still reading 0 for current,SSI-O
50697,"oh, pot, your circuit is broken",SSI-O
50698,and we know the resistance,SSI-O
50699,so our total resistance is 180,SSI-O
50700,V/R=I,SSI-O
50701,0.78/10=I,SSI-O
50702,okay now i have a reading,SSI-O
50703,its 77.8 miliamps,SSI-O
50704,now my reading is gone,SSI-O
50705,4.44=(0.078)(R),SSI-O
50706,So E = IR = (0.078)(180),SSI-O
50707,i need 56 ohm,SSI-O
50708,E = 14.004 V,SSI-O
50709,so resistor 2 is too high,SSI-O
50710,now im at 2.5,SSI-O
50711,2.5,SSI-O
50712,Right now I'm at 150 ohms,SSI-O
50713,5.35 V,SSI-O
50714,"pot: 70 ohm, skillet: 32 ohm",SSI-O
50715,i need 2.5,SSI-O
50716,I'm at 68 ohms,SSI-O
50717,"mine's 2.55, but i need 4.44",SSI-O
50718,ok voltage drop across R0 is 1.71V,SSI-O
50719,okay so e is 14 minus 4.44 minus 2.5 minus 5.35 divided by r0 gives us current,SSI-O
50720,that value is 0.0114,SSI-O
50721,ok i'm at 390,SSI-O
50722,i need 0.69,SSI-O
50723,I need 4.6 V,SSI-O
50724,3.13,SSI-O
50725,current for me is 11.58,SSI-O
50726,resistor at 180,SSI-O
50727,"The problem is that we don't know R0, so we can't find the total resistance",SSI-O
50728,(R0+30)(18.97)=V,SSI-O
50729,lol i think it's 11 volts,SSI-O
50730,thus the voltage is 11v,SSI-O
50731,0.69,SSI-O
50732,voltage drop of 2.58 over R0,SSI-O
50733,3.13,SSI-O
50734,4.6,SSI-O
50735,mine is 0.14,SSI-O
50736,0.19,SSI-O
50737,0.14 too,SSI-O
50738,.01897(r0)=11-(0.19*3),SSI-O
50739,i have 0.19,SSI-O
50740,R0 is 550 ohm,SSI-O
50741,2.58/550 is the current when ours are at the proper values,SSI-O
50742,so 11/550,SSI-O
50743,or 2.58/550,SSI-O
50744,.0046 amp,SSI-O
50745,i need 150 ohm,SSI-O
50746,i need 680,SSI-O
50747,so 1k,SSI-O
50748,i said 550,SSI-O
50749,its your specific voltage drop divided by the current,SSI-O
50750,11v,SSI-O
50751,I need to enter my unknown values still,SSI-O
50752,hi i'm hamster and my voltage should be 3.25v,SSI-O
50753,mine just changed tho,SSI-O
50754,no it got farther from it,SSI-O
50755,I was at like 3.1 before,SSI-O
50756,idk if im reading it wrong w my probes and multimeter but i'm not getting any current at all or voltage on the display,SSI-O
50757,it says 0,SSI-O
50758,im not getting a reading so im not sure,SSI-O
50759,it says my current is 11.21 mA,SSI-O
50760,now 13.61,SSI-O
50761,im at 3.32,SSI-O
50762,2.88,SSI-O
50763,mine is at 270 rn,SSI-O
50764,it's not reading anything,SSI-O
50765,i have my leads on opp ends of the resistor but it still says 0,SSI-O
50766,mine says 2.01,SSI-O
50767,im at 3.23 rn,SSI-O
50768,3.01 now,SSI-O
50769,470 and 3.01,SSI-O
50770,hm 560 and 3.43 now,SSI-O
50771,im at 560 and 3.29,SSI-O
50772,3.29 now,SSI-O
50773,2.91 now,SSI-O

50776,3.09,SSI-O
50777,820 now,SSI-O
50778,3.09,SSI-O
50779,now mine says 3.82,SSI-O
50780,its 820,SSI-O
50781,820 is right,SSI-O
50782,820 again,SSI-O
50783,okay 2.12 this time,SSI-O
50784,i have 1.48,SSI-O

50819,5.37,SSI-O
50820,1.3,SSI-O
50821,3.08 rn,SSI-O

50825,2.96,SSI-O
50826,560 and 5.01,SSI-O
50827,that made mine go up,SSI-O
50828,i need 3.02,SSI-O
50829,i need 5.13,SSI-O
50830,1.48,SSI-O
50831,1.61,SSI-O
50832,i need 1.37,SSI-O
50833,330,SSI-O
50834,560,SSI-O
50835,mine is 150,SSI-O
50836,I got 10.34,SSI-O
50837,Im getting like 13.5 for E,SSI-O
50838,13.54,SSI-O
50839,im getting 12.24,SSI-O
50840,im getting like 10.34,SSI-O
50841,8.96 for me,SSI-O
50842,my goal is 1.5 volts,SSI-O
50843,im at 150 now,SSI-O
50844,my goal is 9.2,SSI-O
50845,my goal is 1.38,SSI-O
50846,my goal is 4.32,SSI-O
50847,im stuck at 9.3,SSI-O
50848,im at 9.4 rn,SSI-O
50849,I was at 1.38 but it dropped to 1.32,SSI-O
50850,im at 150 ohms,SSI-O
50851,im at 390 rn,SSI-O
50852,okay im at 820 and it was just at 9.3 but then it went down to 8.8 im confused,SSI-O
50853,okay im at 9.2,SSI-O
50854,my goal is 8.28,SSI-O
50855,mine is 1.49,SSI-O
50856,mine is .99,SSI-O
50857,I'm at 100 ohms right now at .91,SSI-O
50858,im at 1.58 rn,SSI-O
50859,I'm at 1.06,SSI-O
50860,im at 8.64,SSI-O
50861,im just stuck at 1.53,SSI-O
50862,im at 8.37 rn,SSI-O
50863,I'm at 1.05 with 150 ohms,SSI-O
50864,mine is 220,SSI-O
50865,im using 1.2k,SSI-O
50866,mine went up to 8.57,SSI-O
50867,aw dang mine went up to 1.07,SSI-O
50868,mine went down to 1.29,SSI-O
50869,used 1k and went down to 7.89,SSI-O
50870,i went down to 120 ohms and im at .97,SSI-O
50871,it went back to .85,SSI-O
50872,i was just at 8.28 for a second,SSI-O
50873,still stuck at 1.53,SSI-O
50874,im at 1.02,SSI-O
50875,whatever you did brought me down to 1.51 for a second,SSI-O
50876,okay im at 180 ohms,SSI-O
50877,mine went up to 1.23 volts,SSI-O
50878,okay im at 120 ohms and .99 volts,SSI-O
50879,now its .97,SSI-O
50880,ooh im at 1.49,SSI-O
50881,my goal is 1.73 volts,SSI-O
50882,goal is 6.45,SSI-O
50883,mine is 4.4,SSI-O
50884,"with a 270 ohm resistor, my meter reads 4.61 volts",SSI-O
50885,imm at 100 ohms with 1.71 volts,SSI-O
50886,mine just went down to 4.5,SSI-O
50887,jk just went back,SSI-O
50888,mine is 101.1 and I'm at 100 ohm right now,SSI-O
50889,mine is 4.02,SSI-O
50890,im at 6.45 now,SSI-O
50891,im at 1.37 at 100 ohms,SSI-O
50892,1.23,SSI-O
50893,and i was dividing the current volts by each resistor we were using,SSI-O
50894,im at 4.59 rn with a 390 resistor,SSI-O
50895,im at 1.76 with 150 ohms,SSI-O
50896,1.14,SSI-O
50897,1.23 jk,SSI-O
50898,mines at 4.44 now,SSI-O
50899,im at 6.37 now,SSI-O
50900,without changing it,SSI-O
50901,and your voltage,SSI-O
50902,390,SSI-O
50903,560 and im at 6.37,SSI-O
50904,im at 4.44,SSI-O
50905,she gave me the formula E = I x R0 + I x R1 + I x R2 + I x R3,SSI-O
50906,im at 100 ohms with 1.14 volts,SSI-O
50907,i got .0114 for the current,SSI-O
50908,and when I plugged that in I got E = .0114 x R0 + 11.97,SSI-O
50909,"idk if any of that makes sense, but that was using the resistances you guys had and plugging in the current I got",SSI-O
50910,oh i see so for mine at least im just solving for R2,SSI-O
50911,current,SSI-O
50912,"Idk if I did that formula right, I got 0.04 as I",SSI-O
50913,oh actually mines exact now,SSI-O
50914,E is the sum of all of the voltages,SSI-O
50915,my voltage is 5.88,SSI-O
50916,Mines at 1.82,SSI-O
50917,i have to find 1.56V,SSI-O
50919,9.26+ voltage of R0,SSI-O
50920,1.56,SSI-O
50921,5.88,SSI-O
50922,1.9,SSI-O
50923,i got 6.21V for R0,SSI-O
50924,wait my voltage isn't the same anymore,SSI-O
50925,just need to figure out how,SSI-O
50926,maybe we do 1.56 = I x R0 and solve for I,SSI-O
50927,thats really small number tho,SSI-O
50928,ohm,SSI-O
50929,i have 1000 ohm too for R0,SSI-O
50930,the 6.21V i got when i changed the resistor to 1000 and read the meter,SSI-O
50931,thats what we just tried,SSI-O
50932,oh i guess not because its not R0,SSI-O
50933,mines 180 ohms,SSI-O
50934,680,SSI-O
50935,mine is 220,SSI-O
50936,we know the voltage of R1 + R2 + R3,SSI-O
50937,so for me 1.56V = I x 180ohms then I = 0.00867,SSI-O
50938,so thats I,SSI-O
50939,I got 1.9V=Ix220ohm and got .008636,SSI-O
50940,so V=8.63 for R0,SSI-O
50941,or 8.6,SSI-O
50942,V=IR and R=1000                                              1000X.0086=8.6 V,SSI-O
50943,so add that to 9.34V,SSI-O
50944,which is 17.94,SSI-O
50945,so then multiply that times I,SSI-O
50946,which is 0.154,SSI-O
50947,oh wait maybe it is 17.94,SSI-O
50948,E=V0+V1+V2+V3,SSI-O
50949,it said that in the intro video,SSI-O
50950,680,SSI-O
50951,220,SSI-O
50952,180,SSI-O
50953,or only once,SSI-O
50954,it looks like i still can,SSI-O
50955,how we got our answer,SSI-O
50956,its 18,SSI-O
50957,Iowa got 128.7 ohm,SSI-O
50958,e= 7 volts. goal is 1.75 volts,SSI-O
50959,red on the left,SSI-O
50960,it has to be as close to 1.75 as you can,SSI-O
50961,2.44V,SSI-O
50962,when i put 390 ohm,SSI-O
50963,i get 1.73,SSI-O
50964,same,SSI-O
50965,now it's 1.82,SSI-O
50966,mine is at 1.67 with 330,SSI-O
50967,1.75,SSI-O
50968,at 330,SSI-O
50969,4.15V with 680ohm,SSI-O
50970,"e = 10 volts, R0= 100, goal is 2.34v",SSI-O
50971,okay my goal is 1.88,SSI-O
50972,mine is 4.22,SSI-O
50973,i am at 1.93v at 270 ohm,SSI-O
50974,4.23V at 470 ohm,SSI-O
50975,i am 1.86 at  180,SSI-O
50976,2.27 volts at 220 ohm,SSI-O
50977,2.27 need 2.34,SSI-O
50978,at 2.65 now,SSI-O
50979,4.53 now,SSI-O
50980,i am at 1.88,SSI-O
50981,4.12 at 330 ohm,SSI-O
50982,2.37 need 2.34,SSI-O
50983,my target is 7.2,SSI-O
50984,2.38V,SSI-O
50985,"e = ?, r0 = 560 ohm, goal is 3.39 volts",SSI-O
50986,2.25 at 270ohm,SSI-O
50987,2.32 at 270ohm,SSI-O
50988,now it chagned,SSI-O
50989,i got 2.07 now,SSI-O
50990,270ohm,SSI-O
50991,my resistor is at 390 ohm,SSI-O
50992,right now 2.25V,SSI-O
50993,with 220ohm,SSI-O
50994,now it's 2.07V,SSI-O
50995,now 2,SSI-O
50996,2.32,SSI-O
50997,back at 390,SSI-O
50998,at 330,SSI-O
50999,"E is unknown, R0 = 560 ƒ??, your goal is to make your voltage 2.38 volts.",SSI-O
51000,at 2.32,SSI-O
51001,at 330 ohm. im at 2.83 rn and the target is 3.39,SSI-O
51002,with 270ohm,SSI-O
51003,now 2.25,SSI-O
51004,390 ohm. at 3.25 target is 3.39,SSI-O
51005,i need to go higher,SSI-O
51006,i am at 100ohm,SSI-O
51007,7.2,SSI-O
51008,is mine,SSI-O
51009,0.94,SSI-O
51010,"r0=560 , and goal is 3.39  volts",SSI-O
51011,"E is unknown, R0 = 560 ƒ??, your goal is to make your voltage 2.38 volts",SSI-O
51012,idk if it will help but i calculated current,SSI-O
51013,at 3.36 need to be at 3.39,SSI-O
51014,and it's .0087A,SSI-O
51015,2.38 +3.39+ 7.2=,SSI-O
51016,that what E is,SSI-O
51017,so i need 273.56321ohm,SSI-O
51018,13,SSI-O
51019,V=IR,SSI-O
51020,so i am at 100ohm and i got 0.87V,SSI-O
51021,"R0 = 560 ƒ??, your goal is to make your voltage 7.2 volts.",SSI-O
51022,current is all same,SSI-O
51023,so  I am thinking we can do our calculation,SSI-O
51024,and come up with each voltage,SSI-O
51025,and i will calculate voltage for RO,SSI-O
51026,and we can add em up,SSI-O
51027,my r is 560,SSI-O
51028,mine is 271,SSI-O
51029,271,SSI-O
51030,my r is 560,SSI-O
51031,Ro(560ohm)*.0087(I),SSI-O
51032,"i have 4,872V for RO",SSI-O
51033,okay so mine woukd be 560 *0.072,SSI-O
51034,my goal is 2.38,SSI-O
51035,and Ro is about 4V,SSI-O
51036,im at 3.47 and my goal is 3.39,SSI-O
51037,okay so 4.872+2.38+3.39,SSI-O
51038,without utah i got 10V,SSI-O
51039,she  explianed it as said i ro is 560 riht,SSI-O
51040,my V is 7.2,SSI-O
51041,i sum it up and we supposed to have 17.842,SSI-O
51042,i punched thisnumber in and it says it's wrong haha,SSI-O
51043,17 it is,SSI-O
51044,aye i am at 270,SSI-O
51045,i am at 0.04,SSI-O
51046,when it says your goal is to make your voltage something,SSI-O
51047,this is what i got,SSI-O
51048,2.17v with 270ohm,SSI-O
51049,voltage/,SSI-O
51050,aye everyone has their values,SSI-O
51051,my goal is set for 3.75V,SSI-O
51052,I have 120 Ohms of resistance,SSI-O
51053,my goals is 2.53V,SSI-O
51054,my goal is 0.78V,SSI-O
51055,mine is 3.05,SSI-O
51056,Okay currently with 270 Ohms i am reading 2.62,SSI-O
51057,now its 2.81,SSI-O
51058,i have a reading of 0.78 at 120 ohms,SSI-O
51059,my value is showing,SSI-O
51060,my goal is 9.56,SSI-O
51061,my goal is 4.55V,SSI-O
51062,my goal is 1.75V,SSI-O
51063,mine was 820 ohms,SSI-O
51064,mine is 150 Ohms,SSI-O
51065,Don't forget the R0 value too!,SSI-O
51066,E can also be equal to IxR0 + IxR1...,SSI-O
51067,i have no clue it didnt say,SSI-O
51068,"that was just for our resistor values, nevermind",SSI-O
51069,"I think the reason why E is wrong is  because we didn't add the voltage for R0, that's why it can't be 15.86V",SSI-O
51070,820 ohms,SSI-O
51071,okay when changing my resistor to the 270 Ohms they use in the internal resistor (R0) I read 2.93V. Everything added up I got a total of 18.79V across all resistors and 1630 Ohms across all resistors. But that is before calculating current with I=V/R,SSI-O
51072,I got a current of 11.53 by using I=V/R where V= 18.79v and R= 1.63 Micro Ohms,SSI-O
51073,I have a current reading of 15.32mA,SSI-O
51074,i have a reading of 23.5mA,SSI-O
51075,i got 0.012A or 1.12mA,SSI-O
51076,0.01165 or 1.17,SSI-O
51077,when i divided my voltage (1.75v) by my resistance (150 Ohms) i got 0.011666,SSI-O
51078,or 1.17mA,SSI-O
51079,19 volts,SSI-O
51080,I got 19.0709. So 19,SSI-O
51081,My goal is 4.5,SSI-O
51082,I've got 4.5 on my multimeter,SSI-O
51083,I think E=I x R,SSI-O
51084,that thye gave me,SSI-O
51085,"Okay I'm struggling to even figure out where to put my numbers, my numbers are E=18 and r0=150",SSI-O
51086,my goal is 2.88 volts,SSI-O
51087,Ive got 6.12,SSI-O
51088,My goal is .61 volts,SSI-O
51089,Mine says .61 right now,SSI-O
51090,Never mind it just changed,SSI-O
51091,E= I x R,SSI-O
51092,"Me either, I have E=12v, Ro= 390 and goal of 6.12V",SSI-O
51093,I have those same numbers by .61 volts,SSI-O
51094,Mine reads .59 right now,SSI-O
51095,I'm at 2.78 but need 2.88,SSI-O
51096,Mine dropped,SSI-O
51097,okay im at 2.90,SSI-O
51098,If i put mine up another resistor I am over,SSI-O
51099,Im at .51 now,SSI-O
51100,Mine is jumping from .59 to .61,SSI-O
51101,I'm at 2.78 at 390 ohms,SSI-O
51102,Im at .59 at 82 ohms,SSI-O
51103,I am at 5.85 at 820 ohms,SSI-O
51104,Now 6.07,SSI-O
51105,back down to 5.85,SSI-O
51106,formula,SSI-O
51107,obviously e is 12,SSI-O
51108,Banu just told me the formula we need is E=IR+(IxR1)+(IxR2) +(IxR3),SSI-O
51109,where the values of R1 R2 and R3 would be our three different resistors,SSI-O
51110,I think I is .0307,SSI-O
51111,I believe it is 12/390 assuming E=IR,SSI-O
51112,I really think the resistor I need to use is either 82 or 68 ohms,SSI-O
51113,R0 is defenitely 390,SSI-O
51114,I'm at 2.78 at 390,SSI-O
51115,100 brings me to .71,SSI-O
51116,I need 0.76,SSI-O
51117,my goal is voltage to 2.37,SSI-O
51118,i need 1.4,SSI-O
51119,I'm at 2.33 at 560,SSI-O
51120,1.62 with a 390 ohm resistor,SSI-O
51121,okay im at 2.41,SSI-O
51122,Im at 1.42 now,SSI-O
51123,Probably with the formula I have cuz I have the whole right side now,SSI-O
51124,560,SSI-O
51125,180 ohms,SSI-O
51126,330,SSI-O
51127,that banu told you,SSI-O
51128,I feel like I solved it but it wont work,SSI-O
51129,E=IxR0+V1+V2+V3,SSI-O
51130,I should be .00424 if im not mistaken,SSI-O
51131,for me it would be 1.4/330,SSI-O
51132,for you guys it would be whatever your voltage is divided by resistor,SSI-O
51133,So like the resistor I had was 330 when we completed it,SSI-O
51134,All of our voltage values,SSI-O
51135,so 1.4 .76 2.73,SSI-O
51136,mine is 2.37,SSI-O
51137,and its volts,SSI-O
51138,So E= your 2.37 / your resistance then that value you just solved for x 1890,SSI-O
51139,Mine is 8 volts,SSI-O
51140,It didn,SSI-O
51141,didnt like that I put in the exact value,SSI-O
51142,My exact value was 8.36 and it said that was wrong until I plugged in 8,SSI-O
51143,Yeah mine was 7.99 and i rounded to 8,SSI-O
51144,well we have all the numbers for this one,SSI-O
51145,ight my goal is 4volts,SSI-O
51146,my is 4 V,SSI-O
51147,im ready whenever,SSI-O
51148,ready,SSI-O
51149,okay so my volt needs to be 0.63,SSI-O
51150,mine needs to be 2.95,SSI-O
51151,mine is 0.95 V,SSI-O
51152,like mines decreasing when i have it at a set value,SSI-O
51153,470,SSI-O
51154,470,SSI-O
51155,1.75 v,SSI-O
51156,im at .67 v at 150 resistance,SSI-O
51157,im at 2.65,SSI-O
51158,at 180 ohms it lowers mine to 1 V but i need it to be at .95 V,SSI-O
51159,0.63,SSI-O
51160,0.95,SSI-O
51161,what i need,SSI-O
51162,my goal is 2.22,SSI-O
51163,4.66,SSI-O
51164,my goal is 1.25,SSI-O
51165,im at 4.62 volts atm,SSI-O
51166,need 4.66,SSI-O
51167,i dont have a better idea hahaha,SSI-O
51168,the resistances are added up R1 + R2 +R3,SSI-O
51169,thats what i was thinking at sea,SSI-O
51170,is it different for everyone. mine is 330 ohms,SSI-O
51171,im at 1.3V right now and i need to get to 1.25 so...,SSI-O
51172,2.15,SSI-O
51173,i need 2.22,SSI-O
51174,well im second,SSI-O
51175,down in resistance to increase voltage,SSI-O
51176,so im at 4.83 v i need to be at 4.66,SSI-O
51177,so the first person is the voltage after its been decreased by the r0,SSI-O
51178,470,SSI-O
51179,i have mine set to 270,SSI-O
51180,so what i was thinking,SSI-O
51181,we each indivdually have our own R0,SSI-O
51182,so in the circuit below,SSI-O
51183,we have R0 in series with R1 R2 R3,SSI-O
51184,330,SSI-O
51185,330,SSI-O
51186,we all have the same,SSI-O
51187,we each have our own resistance,SSI-O
51188,4.66,SSI-O
51189,my resistance is 390,SSI-O
51190,820,SSI-O
51191,220,SSI-O
51192,dont forget 330,SSI-O
51193,I have R2. My goal is 4V,SSI-O
51194,"I have R0, my goal voltage is 4V",SSI-O
51195,*R1,SSI-O
51196,DCV 20,SSI-O
51197,"Okay, I have R1",SSI-O
51198,"Then R2, then R3 has the smaller resistance",SSI-O
51199,I have R3,SSI-O
51200,it reads 0.00,SSI-O
51201,Mine is reading 4,SSI-O
51202,Now it reads 4,SSI-O
51203,now it says 4,SSI-O
51204,I have R1 again with a goal voltage of 5.82.,SSI-O
51205,I have R3 and my goal is 1.28V,SSI-O
51206,Peach R2 with a goal of 3.34 volts,SSI-O
51207,Okay my voltmeter reads that im at 2.41V right now. With a resistance of 330,SSI-O
51208,mine reads 7.31,SSI-O
51209,"So every time you increase your resistance, you increase the current",SSI-O
51210,At 0.03V now,SSI-O
51211,Im at a resistance of 560 right now and im reading 3.29V. i need to get it to 5.82V,SSI-O
51212,"Well, once R1 is done adjusting, R2 will adjust and mess it up",SSI-O
51213,Because the total current is dependent on the total resistance,SSI-O
51214,So let's say the total resistance in is 2000 ohms,SSI-O
51215,Then the current would be 0.0095,SSI-O
51216,With R1 having the higher resistance and R2 following then R3,SSI-O
51217,The reason why all 3 of us need to add up to 1000 ohms is because R0 is 1000 ohms,SSI-O
51218,it reads 3.03,SSI-O
51219,Only lets me set to 470 or 560,SSI-O
51220,R2,SSI-O
51221,i'm at 330,SSI-O
51222,R2 330 and the meter reads 3.03,SSI-O
51223,R1 at 470 reading 4.31,SSI-O
51224,goal is 5.82,SSI-O
51225,"At 680 and reading 5.67, almost at 5.82",SSI-O
51226,330 Ohms and 2.68 DCV 20,SSI-O
51227,3.34 volts,SSI-O
51228,just me and peach already exceed the overall resistance,SSI-O
51229,5.38V with a resistance of 680,SSI-O
51230,"R1, goal is 3.6V",SSI-O
51231,Im not,SSI-O
51232,R2 390Ohms,SSI-O
51233,goal is 7.47,SSI-O
51234,I'm R2,SSI-O
51235,im R3,SSI-O
51236,Ok. So that means that R3 needs a small resistance,SSI-O
51237,3.08,SSI-O
51238,R2 = 3.08,SSI-O
51239,R1=3.08,SSI-O
51240,R3 = 3.08,SSI-O
51241,"Im at 3.08V, need to get to 3.6V",SSI-O
51242,R3 at 390 ohms 7.7 on the meter and my goal is 7.47,SSI-O
51243,its 7.04 now,SSI-O
51244,that made it lower,SSI-O
51245,maybe I should increase mine,SSI-O
51246,i was at 390,SSI-O
51247,"Im at 3V, need to be at 3.6",SSI-O
51248,220 is the R0,SSI-O
51249,150 and 3V,SSI-O
51250,My goal is 3.6V lol,SSI-O
51251,Now im at 3.55V,SSI-O
51252,330 Ohms,SSI-O
51253,6.5 on meter,SSI-O
51254,7.47 is my goal,SSI-O
51255,7.01,SSI-O
51256,my goal is 4.75,SSI-O
51257,that gets me 5.91 volts,SSI-O
51258,It has to be 470 ohms. We each have to have the same voltage drop and that means we multiply 4.75 by 3 and subtract the total (19) to get 4.75 V for the 470 ohm resistor meaning ours has to be 470 ohms,SSI-O
51259,my goal is 3.33 v,SSI-O
51260,mines 2.81,SSI-O
51261,4.01,SSI-O
51262,330 for Baked,SSI-O
51263,470 for Fries,SSI-O
51264,470,SSI-O
51265,goal is 4.65,SSI-O
51266,my goal is 1.95,SSI-O
51267,2.12,SSI-O
51268,im at 1.68 i need 1.69,SSI-O
51269,I get up to 4.77 volts,SSI-O
51270,180,SSI-O
51271,Mine is 180,SSI-O
51272,390,SSI-O
51273,2.13 just then,SSI-O
51274,im at 1.69,SSI-O
51275,I'm at .66,SSI-O
51276,and the only way to find that out is using the current. and we can find the current once the resistors match as we will have the total resistance along with the current.,SSI-O
51277,150 Ohms,SSI-O
51278,120 Ohms,SSI-O
51279,im at 330,SSI-O
51280,was 680*.01667,SSI-O
51281,i dont have a calculator,SSI-O
51282,13.026,SSI-O
51283,It wrong,SSI-O
51284,its 11.024 volts,SSI-O
51285,the current is .01413,SSI-O
51286,so it's 780 * .o1413,SSI-O
51287,my current is .01607,SSI-O
51288,i got .01413 as well,SSI-O
51289,Its to the nearest whole number it was 11 volts,SSI-O
51290,goal is 3.25,SSI-O
51291,im at 4.41,SSI-O
51292,4.02 now,SSI-O
51293,it changes all of them,SSI-O
51294,i got 3.57,SSI-O
51295,same here 3.57,SSI-O

51446,at 560,SSI-O
51447,4.82,SSI-O
51448,4.67,SSI-O
51449,ok so our total R is 220,SSI-O
51450,that puts us at 330ohms,SSI-O
51451,so the current is going to be .0818,SSI-O
51452,if its 18v and the total r is 220 and we divide the v/r,SSI-O
51453,ryan said he would figure it out,SSI-O
51454,hes checking his notes,SSI-O
51455,i think im at 4.7 v rn,SSI-O
51456,4.5,SSI-O
51457,mine is 4.5v,SSI-O
51458,mine says 4.66 rn,SSI-O
51459,0.08,SSI-O
51460,we have the current and the voltage he wants us at,SSI-O
51461,p=.36,SSI-O
51462,ok so we have the total v,SSI-O
51463,and we all have our personal v,SSI-O
51464,so 4.5x3 is 13.5,SSI-O
51465,wt 10,SSI-O
51466,.72v,SSI-O
51467,0.72,SSI-O

51475,at 820,SSI-O
51476,or something,SSI-O
51477,5.59,SSI-O
51478,im trting to figure it out,SSI-O
51479,7.83,SSI-O
51480,im supposed to be at 1.72,SSI-O
51481,3.06,SSI-O
51482,1.9 volts,SSI-O
51483,im at 220,SSI-O
51484,6.92,SSI-O
51485,1.83,SSI-O
51486,1.02,SSI-O
51487,blue is 1.02,SSI-O
51488,so my resistance is at 390 right now,SSI-O
51489,im r1,SSI-O
51490,i need 4.5 volts,SSI-O
51491,i need 4.5 too,SSI-O
51492,11.25 for current,SSI-O
51493,so at the top its giving me 18 voltsa,SSI-O
51494,i thought current should be the same throughout the whole circuit,SSI-O
51495,maybe something with power,SSI-O
51496,sorry my goal is 4.5v,SSI-O
51497,ok so my resistor is 820 ohms,SSI-O
51498,total of all resisitors is 2460,SSI-O
51499,because theres only 3,SSI-O
51500,i got 5.48,SSI-O
51501,mili amps,SSI-O
51502,5.48,SSI-O
51503,so when i try to find resistance by doing R3=Vr3/IT i get around 820,SSI-O
51504,since we all have the same voltage goal,SSI-O
51505,the closest i got was to 4.95,SSI-O
51506,with a 1k r,SSI-O
51507,were at 4.7,SSI-O
51508,i am',SSI-O
51509,it dropped,SSI-O
51510,4.05,SSI-O
51511,3.84,SSI-O
51512,mines at 369,SSI-O
51513,469,SSI-O
51514,4.48 right there,SSI-O
51515,im at 4.48,SSI-O
51516,theres a tolerance,SSI-O
51517,so i was at 1k,SSI-O
51518,when it was 4.48,SSI-O
51519,im at 4.7 now,SSI-O
51520,4.71,SSI-O
51521,so r0 volts is 4.5 too,SSI-O
51522,its gotta be 820,SSI-O
51523,i need .43 volts,SSI-O
51524,my goal is 1.16 volts,SSI-O
51525,i need 2.91,SSI-O
51526,my voltage reading is at 2.43,SSI-O
51527,i need 4.59 volts,SSI-O
51528,i need 1.03,SSI-O
51529,i need 1.55,SSI-O
51530,im at 1.56,SSI-O
51531,im at 5.76,SSI-O
51532,im at 2.2,SSI-O
51533,ohms,SSI-O
51534,ok im at 1k,SSI-O
51535,im at 1k. its reading 4.62,SSI-O
51536,4.62,SSI-O
51537,total voltage is 17 then,SSI-O
51538,1.03 here,SSI-O
51539,8.59,SSI-O
51540,im at 5.59,SSI-O
51541,so the voltage of r0 is 5.83,SSI-O
51542,5.83/820,SSI-O
51543,i got 7mili amps,SSI-O
51544,4.47 is what i got,SSI-O
51545,100 ohms,SSI-O
51546,i think i need to be at 180,SSI-O
51547,ok im at 1.5,SSI-O
51548,resisitor,SSI-O
51549,180,SSI-O
51550,im at 1.5,SSI-O
51551,to 1.2,SSI-O
51552,150 now,SSI-O
51553,4.21V,SSI-O
51554,.51 v,SSI-O
51555,0.42,SSI-O
51556,i got 8,SSI-O
51557,so our vin would be 8 voltys,SSI-O
51558,we dont have a resistance for r0,SSI-O
51559,R0 VOLTAGE IS GONNA BE 2.86V,SSI-O
51560,its saying its wrong,SSI-O
51561,but the volts is correct,SSI-O
51562,E,SSI-O
51563,4.57 mili amps,SSI-O
51564,im not getting any reading,SSI-O
51565,1.6k ohms for total resistor,SSI-O
51566,4.91 is current,SSI-O
51567,2.86/4.91,SSI-O
51568,thats r0 resistance,SSI-O
51569,got 1.9 v,SSI-O
51570,i have 1.9,SSI-O
51571,im at 2.09,SSI-O
51572,im still at 150,SSI-O
51573,it changed to 2.11,SSI-O
51574,i got 1.68,SSI-O
51575,its 150,SSI-O
51576,ok im at 2v,SSI-O
51577,im at 1.6,SSI-O
51578,at 150 i got 1.9 v,SSI-O
51579,it said 2 now says 1.9,SSI-O
51580,680,SSI-O
51581,im on 680 and now at 11.97,SSI-O
51582,0.01,SSI-O

51590,i have 3.25v,SSI-O
51591,2.07v,SSI-O
51592,thats just for Ro,SSI-O
51593,so 2 need 1 volt and one needs 1.25,SSI-O
51594,"current is the same throughout the whole circuit, im just not sure if it needs to be the voltage drop of R0 or total voltage",SSI-O
51595,I=.013A OR 13mA,SSI-O

51719,i had my resistor out. my target is 0.8v and im at 0.81,SSI-O
51720,my target is 4.49,SSI-O
51721,4.26,SSI-O
51722,1k,SSI-O
51723,18 v,SSI-O
51724,150,SSI-O
51725,So 3.75V...,SSI-O
51726,I'm at 560ohm,SSI-O
51727,560,SSI-O
51728,at 470 and its showing 4.1v,SSI-O
51729,im at 3.57v,SSI-O
51730,Mine's showing 3.75v,SSI-O
51731,mine is 5.38,SSI-O
51732,Still says one person's not at 3.75v,SSI-O
51733,Dog = Circuit 1,SSI-O
51734,Cat = Circuit 2,SSI-O
51735,Hamster = Circuit 3,SSI-O
51736,"Which it did for a minute, but it still didn't take it for some reason",SSI-O
51737,i got 3.72,SSI-O
51738,3.72,SSI-O
51739,3.93,SSI-O
51740,3.93 now,SSI-O
51741,at 270,SSI-O
51742,Shows 3.72,SSI-O
51743,330ohm shows 4.3,SSI-O
51744,270,SSI-O
51745,3.72,SSI-O
51746,im at 270,SSI-O
51747,Alright mine's showing 4.76,SSI-O
51748,3.17-220 now,SSI-O
51749,mines showing 3.89,SSI-O
51750,3.55,SSI-O
51751,4.13,SSI-O
51752,3.78v,SSI-O
51753,1.5,SSI-O
51754,mine is 2.17,SSI-O
51755,2.69 here @ 560ohm,SSI-O
51756,1kohm @ 4.08v,SSI-O
51757,3.57v,SSI-O
51758,3.92v,SSI-O
51759,mine is 1.66 now,SSI-O
51760,I got the voltage we need to calculate the resistances,SSI-O
51761,.005548780 amps,SSI-O
51762,mine is 390,SSI-O
51763,i am 270n,SSI-O
51764,my goal is 2.46,SSI-O
51765,Mine's 3.51,SSI-O
51766,my goal is 2.91,SSI-O
51767,i have a plan,SSI-O
51768,Oh wait i'm the first resistor in the circuit,SSI-O
51769,at 390,SSI-O
51770,shows 3.79ohm,SSI-O
51771,3.51v,SSI-O
51772,2.62,SSI-O
51773,mine is 2.91,SSI-O
51774,So the calculators saying I should be at 361ohm,SSI-O
51775,but that's not an option I have 390 and 330,SSI-O
51776,Mine's at 390 rn I think,SSI-O
51777,0.009718,SSI-O
51778,the total voltage between the three of us is 9.04,SSI-O
51779,0.009703,SSI-O
51780,got 361ohm,SSI-O
51781,.1 here,SSI-O
51782,ok i got 1,SSI-O
51783,Amperage says 15.6,SSI-O
51784,Ooooo 3.58 showing up on mine,SSI-O
51785,I have 390ohm on the board,SSI-O
51786,470ohm showing 3.67,SSI-O
51787,2.46--270,SSI-O
51788,3.51--395,SSI-O
51789,2.91--327,SSI-O
51790,i am 270 now,SSI-O
51791,i am 2.5 now,SSI-O
51792,3.42,SSI-O
51793,Or I'm circuit 1,SSI-O
51794,3.67 showing up,SSI-O
51795,I'm at 470,SSI-O
51796,3.85 now,SSI-O
51797,2.37 now,SSI-O
51798,3.42...,SSI-O
51799,now im at 2.91,SSI-O
51800,3.4,SSI-O
51801,390,SSI-O
51802,I needa be at  3.51,SSI-O
51803,3.59,SSI-O
51804,3.75,SSI-O
51805,3.88 now,SSI-O
51806,3.75 on mine now,SSI-O
51807,270 puts it low,SSI-O
51808,3.29,SSI-O
51809,Back at 330,SSI-O
51810,18.18,SSI-O
51811,i am here,SSI-O
51812,i am 15.15,SSI-O
51813,16.67 now,SSI-O
51814,voltage shows 3.55 now tho,SSI-O
51815,2.91v,SSI-O
51816,mine still 2.46,SSI-O
51817,Mine's there,SSI-O
51818,2.46,SSI-O
51819,it is 390 now,SSI-O
51820,Shows 2.62,SSI-O
51821,shows 3.1,SSI-O
51822,super low on my end,SSI-O
51823,Oh it was at 330,SSI-O
51824,390 shows 2.95,SSI-O
51825,Still super low,SSI-O
51826,10.75 @ 390,SSI-O
51827,10.75,SSI-O
51828,@390,SSI-O
51829,at 150,SSI-O
51830,1.39v,SSI-O
51831,10.75ohm,SSI-O
51832,at 1.39,SSI-O
51833,"mine is 1,79",SSI-O
51834,14.49 ohm,SSI-O
51835,3.61,SSI-O
51836,2.95,SSI-O
51837,2.95 now,SSI-O
51838,7.16v didn't work,SSI-O
51839,mine says 3.5V Goa,SSI-O
51840,We all got 3.5v I think,SSI-O
51841,"ok, so we have source V=14V",SSI-O
51842,i think it's 3.5 each,SSI-O
51843,which means there is a 3.5 loss across the 180 too,SSI-O
51844,10.5 reduction from us and 14 total,SSI-O
51845,ok I'm at 180 ohm reading 3.32 volts,SSI-O
51846,I'm at 3.5,SSI-O
51847,i have 3.5,SSI-O
51848,I'm at 3.5 too,SSI-O
51849,"ok, so I have 2.1",SSI-O
51850,I need 7.79 volts,SSI-O
51851,I need 1.71 V,SSI-O
51852,so we lose 6.4 across the 820 ohm,SSI-O
51853,so 6.4 from R0,SSI-O
51854,7.805 mA,SSI-O
51855,i'm 1k ohm,SSI-O
51856,I'm 269,SSI-O
51857,it was like .00780487 or something,SSI-O
51858,7.79 flat,SSI-O
51859,I need 2.27 volts,SSI-O
51860,I need 1.26 volts,SSI-O
51861,5.42 volts,SSI-O
51862,im measuring 6.38 mv,SSI-O
51863,I have 8.1,SSI-O
51864,series amps,SSI-O
51865,It wants to be 1k,SSI-O
51866,It wants to still be 1.26 mA,SSI-O
51867,mine changed...,SSI-O
51868,still getting 6.38,SSI-O
51869,now I'm back at 8.65,SSI-O
51870,"wait a second, it just jumped",SSI-O
51871,i went to like 9 now im back to 6.3,SSI-O
51872,It's all consistent because of the series,SSI-O
51873,"So we are using the same current, I guess.",SSI-O
51874,I have 6,SSI-O
51875,6mA,SSI-O
51876,24 volts,SSI-O
51877,=,SSI-O
51878,I'm getting ~378,SSI-O
51879,closest option is 390,SSI-O
51880,which is somethign we came up with,SSI-O
51881,the R0,SSI-O
51882,I think forcing the current didnt exactly get us anywhere,SSI-O
51883,R0 needs to use 18.58 V,SSI-O
51884,.01858 amps,SSI-O
51885,my result would be ~122 ohms or 120 ohm is the closest,SSI-O
51886,I get 101.7,SSI-O
51887,120 ohm,SSI-O
51888,I'm on 100,SSI-O
51889,im reading .97 volts so far,SSI-O
51890,I'm only reading 1.68,SSI-O
51891,I'm at 1.4,SSI-O
51892,I'm reading 1.0,SSI-O
51893,"ok the order of series is pliers, then me, then wrench",SSI-O
51894,the sum of what we just put,SSI-O
51895,the sum of our volt goals,SSI-O
51896,we need the right amps to use,SSI-O
51897,It'd be around 5 amd a half.,SSI-O
51898,"we know our total V, just like the first ones",SSI-O
51899,it says 24v is incorrect,SSI-O
51900,24 isnt right,SSI-O
51901,thye current changes as the load changes,SSI-O
51902,"we know the sum of the voltage across our aggregate, i.e. what our resultant divided voltage should be",SSI-O
51903,"Alright, so now we know V",SSI-O
51904,"ok, so 18-5.42",SSI-O
51905,13.42,SSI-O
51906,so 12.58 used by R0,SSI-O
51907,I get 12.58 mA,SSI-O
51908,180 ohms,SSI-O
51909,so 150 ohm for me,SSI-O
51910,I'm at 1.93 now,SSI-O
51911,2.27 on the mooney,SSI-O
51912,They're both down,SSI-O
51913,i need 1.22 volts,SSI-O
51914,Ineed 4.79,SSI-O
51915,I need 2.75 Volts,SSI-O
51916,8.76 total,SSI-O
51917,2.12 V,SSI-O
51918,26.2 mA,SSI-O
51919,so we have 6.36 V of 8.76,SSI-O
51920,right now we total 6.36,SSI-O
51921,mine is at 1.59 now,SSI-O
51922,okay between 270 ohm and 330 ohm,SSI-O
51923,bc ours change too,SSI-O
51924,"i read 4.3, which means we're at 8.52 i think",SSI-O
51925,total voltage drop,SSI-O
51926,"well, ours will be the same at 100ohm",SSI-O
51927,It's 1.59,SSI-O
51928,4.18,SSI-O
51929,1.86,SSI-O
51930,1.55,SSI-O
51931,7.59 total,SSI-O
51932,circuit 3,SSI-O
51933,circuit 2,SSI-O
51934,got 2 here,SSI-O
51935,"12 volts, r0 220, goal voltage is 3",SSI-O
51936,my resistance is down to180 now,SSI-O
51937,mine is 120,SSI-O
51938,mine says r0 should be 220,SSI-O
51939,"we don't have control of r0, thats fixed",SSI-O
51940,alright my resistance  is 180 now,SSI-O
51941,"so we have a 180,180, and a 120",SSI-O
51942,at 120,SSI-O
51943,so 120 120 and 180,SSI-O
51944,cause we are at 2.25,SSI-O
51945,my voltmeter says 3.37 rn,SSI-O
51946,"mine is 2.36, needs to be 3 at circuit 2",SSI-O
51947,150,SSI-O
51948,3,SSI-O
51949,so resistance. i have 120,SSI-O
51950,maynard you have 150,SSI-O
51951,120,SSI-O
51952,ok so our equilavent reistance is 220+240+150,SSI-O
51953,19.6 mA,SSI-O
51954,that's what we  need to be 3,SSI-O
51955,my voltage is 2.95 at the moment,SSI-O
51956,mine is 2.36,SSI-O
51957,mine is 2.36 as well,SSI-O
51958,3.38,SSI-O
51959,ok right now our eq. reisstance is 880,SSI-O
51960,circuit 1,SSI-O
51961,circuit 3 needs 4.88 V,SSI-O
51962,my resistance is 180,SSI-O
51963,circuit 1 needs to be 7.06,SSI-O
51964,so in my case I need 2.81 V,SSI-O
51965,i need 7.06 and  i am currently at 7.23,SSI-O
51966,circuit 1 needs voltage to be 7.06,SSI-O
51967,7.06,SSI-O
51968,ok so the voltage drop from resistor 0 is,SSI-O
51969,2.46,SSI-O
51970,and I need 2.81,SSI-O
51971,"so, 12 - I(120) - 7.06 - 2.81 = 0",SSI-O
51972,so starting with resistor 1. we have a voltage of 13.54 to work with,SSI-O
51973,"whoops, forgot mine, -4.88",SSI-O
51974,7.06,SSI-O
51975,ok so using 14.54 as our starting voltagre,SSI-O
51976,you need almost half of that,SSI-O
51977,which means the sum or 2 and 3 equals youres,SSI-O
51978,390,SSI-O
51979,so 7.06/390,SSI-O
51980,i get a current of 18.1,SSI-O
51981,0.018102564,SSI-O
51982,I got I = 0.0104,SSI-O
51983,maynard your resistance is 7.06/your current,SSI-O
51984,so that would be 392,SSI-O
51985,my resistor is currently 390,SSI-O
51986,"we all have the same current, should be 0.0104",SSI-O
51987,now i got 678.846,SSI-O
51988,so after your voltagre drop,SSI-O
51989,so there is 6.5 volts left,SSI-O
51990,and I need 2.81 of that,SSI-O
51991,using the current of .01,SSI-O
51992,i get a reistor or 270,SSI-O
51993,circuit 3: goal voltage is 5.06,SSI-O
51994,3.5,SSI-O
51995,circuit 1 voltage 7.44,SSI-O
51996,mine currently reads 10.47,SSI-O
51997,E - I(270) -7.44 - 3.5 - 5.06 = 0,SSI-O
51998,im at 270,SSI-O
51999,cool 4.5 x 4 = 18,SSI-O
52000,e = 18,SSI-O
52001,im getting a reading,SSI-O
52002,circuit 1 7.44,SSI-O
52003,3.5,SSI-O
52004,5.06,SSI-O
52005,3.5 for circuit 2,SSI-O
52006,I = 0.0074 A,SSI-O
52007,472,SSI-O
52008,683..78,SSI-O
52009,so I have one now,SSI-O
52010,circuit 3: goal voltage is 3.91 v,SSI-O
52011,and my voltage is .59,SSI-O
52012,circuit 2 voltage 2.66v,SSI-O
52013,i have 2.54,SSI-O
52014,jk i have 10.71,SSI-O
52015,my current voltage is .90,SSI-O
52016,100 ohms,SSI-O
52017,1.17,SSI-O
52018,1.17 now,SSI-O
52019,so the equation is,SSI-O
52020,im getting three,SSI-O
52021,8.2M ohms,SSI-O
52022,2.99,SSI-O
52023,so the E is atleast 9,SSI-O
52024,my voltage is now 3.91,SSI-O
52025,I need 4 as well,SSI-O
52026,so we can work collaboratively and help eachother,SSI-O
52027,it's only giving me certain values,SSI-O
52028,ohhh I found it,SSI-O
52029,that went so bad so fast,SSI-O
52030,my goal is 3.51,SSI-O
52031,mine is .09,SSI-O
52032,4.23,SSI-O
52033,me,SSI-O
52034,we know its 150 tho,SSI-O
52035,but we know its 150,SSI-O
52036,omg we can just measure I with the meter,SSI-O
52037,thats what I was saying,SSI-O
52038,"oh okay, i thought each one just affected the ones after it, my bad",SSI-O
52039,so I need to be .423 of the Resistance,SSI-O
52040,our nubmers changed :'(,SSI-O
52041,I have .9 Volts now,SSI-O
52042,I have 2.35,SSI-O
52043,I have the last resistor R3 at 180 ohm,SSI-O
52044,I'm at 470,SSI-O
52045,and edit resistor and a drop down thing will pop up,SSI-O
52046,mine is 180,SSI-O
52047,the thing in the middle of the board,SSI-O
52048,its striped,SSI-O
52049,It's at 150,SSI-O
52050,"so we have 150, 180 and 470",SSI-O
52051,remember Ro is 1000,SSI-O
52052,there's no 450,SSI-O
52053,all i got from the video was e = ir,SSI-O
52054,E(voltage)=I(current)*R(resistance),SSI-O
52055,E=IR,SSI-O
52056,it's a ratio at this point,SSI-O
52057,9/4 = 2.25,SSI-O
52058,im at 1000,SSI-O
52059,9,SSI-O
52060,my goal is 2.86 volts,SSI-O
52061,i gotta get 3.47,SSI-O
52062,i need 1.99 volts,SSI-O
52063,that means Ro needs 2.29,SSI-O
52064,i am at 3.82,SSI-O
52065,i am 1.79,SSI-O
52066,with 470 horseshoes,SSI-O
52067,i hvae 100 ohms,SSI-O
52068,1000,SSI-O
52069,1.78,SSI-O
52070,now im at 4.57,SSI-O
52071,2.15,SSI-O
52072,i am at 1.74 i need 1.99,SSI-O
52073,"im at 3.61, need 3.47",SSI-O
52074,i'm still 0,SSI-O
52075,my red lead was slightly off,SSI-O
52076,i'm at 470,SSI-O
52077,3.15,SSI-O
52078,1.85,SSI-O
52079,we don't,SSI-O
52080,my goal is 4.5,SSI-O
52081,mine's at 14.91 now,SSI-O
52082,okay mine is 2.03,SSI-O
52083,now mine is 8.26,SSI-O
52084,V=IR,SSI-O
52085,okay i have 3.99,SSI-O
52086,but circut 2 go before 3,SSI-O
52087,4 on the little device in the corner,SSI-O
52088,on the multimeter,SSI-O
52089,but under amp its 06.7,SSI-O
52090,okay mine says -2.29,SSI-O
52091,now -3.30,SSI-O
52092,cause the - just means the probes are switched sides,SSI-O
52093,oh mine went up,SSI-O
52094,I'm at 2.67,SSI-O
52095,im at 3.83,SSI-O
52096,i'm at 4.65 dcv 20 with a 680 resistance,SSI-O
52097,wait I got it,SSI-O
52098,I can get 4.64 with 820 on resistor,SSI-O
52099,or 4.03 with 680,SSI-O
52100,4.03 at 680.,SSI-O
52101,actually that is probably too low,SSI-O
52102,wait it dropped,SSI-O
52103,"I have 4.03, nevermind its 3.85",SSI-O
52104,4.45,SSI-O
52105,4.27,SSI-O
52106,405,SSI-O
52107,i havent been changing anything,SSI-O
52108,Okay. so i am sitting at 820 rn,SSI-O
52109,i'm at 1k now,SSI-O
52110,i had 4.00 at one point,SSI-O
52111,i was at 820,SSI-O
52112,1.78 goal,SSI-O
52113,my goal is 5.38,SSI-O
52114,I'm 1.18,SSI-O

52127,I am at 1.99 now,SSI-O
52128,it doesn't really matter,SSI-O
52129,im at 680,SSI-O
52130,4.92,SSI-O
52131,now 5.13,SSI-O
52132,im at 4.89 now,SSI-O

52160,6.95,SSI-O
52161,1.48. i didnt change anything,SSI-O
52162,only 2.42,SSI-O
52163,6.53,SSI-O
52164,5.04 now,SSI-O
52165,5.04,SSI-O
52166,4.28,SSI-O
52167,"im up to 560 ohms a,d 4.28 volts",SSI-O
52168,im at 680,SSI-O
52169,im at 680 too actually,SSI-O
52170,im at 820 now,SSI-O
52171,ohms and volts,SSI-O
52172,on the multi meter,SSI-O
52173,mine shows 390 ohm but no voltage,SSI-O
52174,my multimeter is not showing any values even when it's connected...,SSI-O
52175,we have to connect the green wires,SSI-O
52176,to the breadboard,SSI-O
52177,"Okay, so if you move the red lead to the left wire it shows v",SSI-O
52178,20 i think,SSI-O
52179,im between 15 and 18 ohms right now,SSI-O
52180,im at 150,SSI-O
52181,ok now im at 100,SSI-O
52182,82,SSI-O
52183,im at like 470 right now,SSI-O
52184,im at 39 ohm,SSI-O
52185,im at 100 still but i need to be much higher in voltage,SSI-O
52186,I'm at 68 ohm,SSI-O
52187,im like at 7 and i need 7.25,SSI-O
52188,im at 1.69 i need 1.95,SSI-O
52189,im at 1.97 V,SSI-O
52190,im at 390,SSI-O
52191,I'm at 2.64 and I need 2.92,SSI-O
52192,6.42 V,SSI-O
52193,now I'm at 2.96,SSI-O
52194,I'm at 180ohms,SSI-O
52195,well we're not allowed to write anything so the formula is useless,SSI-O
52196,hey so im at 560,SSI-O
52197,im at 150,SSI-O
52198,I'm at 220,SSI-O
52199,i need 1.95V i'm at 1.89V now with 150 ohm,SSI-O
52200,I need 2.92volts,SSI-O
52201,"so its about 3+2+7, which is almost 13...",SSI-O
52202,the third person is bear,SSI-O
52203,you have to keep the green ones plugged in,SSI-O
52204,i am reading 2.29,SSI-O
52205,i got 2.75,SSI-O
52206,three,SSI-O
52207,it waiting on the third person,SSI-O
52208,bear you nplugged,SSI-O
52209,bear the resistor too,SSI-O
52210,he put it in,SSI-O
52211,1k,SSI-O
52212,the voltage will be like 3-3.48,SSI-O
52213,some one changed that,SSI-O
52214,680 and 560 isn't going through,SSI-O
52215,"Alright, mine is at 560",SSI-O
52216,i got around 3.4-3.5,SSI-O
52217,but its changing now,SSI-O
52218,im getting 3.13,SSI-O
52219,got 3.32,SSI-O
52220,because its changing,SSI-O
52221,Me too. 3.32,SSI-O
52222,it needs higher value now,SSI-O
52223,120,SSI-O
52224,120K,SSI-O
52225,180,SSI-O
52226,180K,SSI-O
52227,i got 0.69,SSI-O
52228,it reduced not to 0.11,SSI-O
52229,its not stable,SSI-O
52230,39,SSI-O
52231,39K,SSI-O
52232,its on 20,SSI-O
52233,thats cause you are connecting the wires wrong,SSI-O
52234,I GOT 5.47,SSI-O
52235,ITS 33K OHM,SSI-O
52236,i got 3.65,SSI-O
52237,29k says -4.45,SSI-O
52238,33k says 0.01,SSI-O
52239,my goal is 2.75,SSI-O
52240,Mine is also 2.5,SSI-O
52241,my goal is 2.75,SSI-O
52242,the resister,SSI-O
52243,"I think we put them on either side of the resistor, but not 100% sure",SSI-O
52244,20 DCV,SSI-O
52245,mine is 2.03 currently,SSI-O
52246,im at 5.21 ohms,SSI-O
52247,i have resister 2,SSI-O
52248,Total voltage is 11,SSI-O
52249,The current changes depending on the resistance we have it at,SSI-O
52250,in on 10,SSI-O
52251,0.26,SSI-O
52252,Mine says 0.26,SSI-O
52253,0.26,SSI-O
52254,"Okay, so we have a total resistance of 320 I think",SSI-O
52255,And a total voltage of 11,SSI-O
52256,oooh so theres a 4th resister,SSI-O
52257,R0 is 390,SSI-O
52258,It's the same for all of us,SSI-O
52259,ok and we are all at 10 ohms,SSI-O
52260,1.6,SSI-O
52261,1.42,SSI-O
52262,1.64,SSI-O
52263,1.59,SSI-O
52264,2.3,SSI-O
52265,2.3,SSI-O
52266,270,SSI-O
52267,2.48,SSI-O
52268,2.47,SSI-O
52269,Mine says 2.47 too,SSI-O
52270,330,SSI-O
52271,2.63,SSI-O
52272,2.63,SSI-O
52273,V=IR,SSI-O
52274,Which means our current and resistance will be proportionate,SSI-O
52275,And all our current should be the same,SSI-O
52276,mines 2.75,SSI-O
52277,Mine is also 2.75,SSI-O
52278,2.75,SSI-O
52279,2.75,SSI-O
52280,goal 8.03,SSI-O
52281,Mine's 1.2,SSI-O
52282,my goal is 0.8,SSI-O
52283,my goal is 0.8 and at 120 ohms I'm at 0.7,SSI-O
52284,So it's gotta be coordinated,SSI-O
52285,at 120 mine is 2.75,SSI-O
52286,"so R1 needs 0.8 V, R2 needs 8.03 V, and R3 needs 1.2 V",SSI-O
52287,We also know all the voltages have to add up to 11,SSI-O
52288,0.8+.8.03+1.2,SSI-O
52289,So R0 has a voltage of .97,SSI-O
52290,The current is gonna be like .00808333333 apparently,SSI-O
52291,"Mine was like 148.45, which I can round to 150 I guess",SSI-O
52292,9.57,SSI-O
52293,993.81,SSI-O
52294,okay mine is on 10,SSI-O
52295,im at 1000,SSI-O
52296,and my v is 8.59,SSI-O
52297,.08008333333 repeating,SSI-O
52298,Yeah I still get 150,SSI-O
52299,im at 2.75,SSI-O

52312,should be on DCV 20,SSI-O
52313,meter isnt reading now,SSI-O
52314,wont let me progress,SSI-O
52315,everything is good tho,SSI-O
52316,goal is 4.64,SSI-O
52317,i need 2.24 :),SSI-O
52318,ok im at 820 ohms,SSI-O
52319,at 4.62,SSI-O
52320,need 64,SSI-O
52321,im at 680 now,SSI-O

52353,2.83,SSI-O
52354,now it is,SSI-O
52355,ok my goal is 1.69,SSI-O
52356,mine is 4.31,SSI-O
52357,"2,08",SSI-O
52358,reading 2.17v,SSI-O
52359,"ok, now im at 3.14",SSI-O
52360,reading 1.88v at 390 ohms,SSI-O
52361,mine jumped,SSI-O
52362,ok so now mines at 4.9,SSI-O
52363,ok so now its 5.37,SSI-O
52364,when i calculated mine i needed 120 ohms for my resistor,SSI-O
52365,220 ohms,SSI-O
52366,reading 1.74,SSI-O
52367,1.94v,SSI-O

52372,but def not getting that reading,SSI-O
52373,im reading 1.94,SSI-O
52374,4.94 for me,SSI-O
52375,1.06,SSI-O
52376,22.533 is my calc based on dividing by .075,SSI-O
52377,so now mine is .7,SSI-O
52378,mine is 3.80,SSI-O
52379,its there,SSI-O
52380,i have 1.58,SSI-O
52381,should all have same curretn in a series i thought,SSI-O
52382,we should,SSI-O
52383,it changes depending on the total resistance,SSI-O
52384,i'm at 1.68,SSI-O
52385,im not green,SSI-O
52386,my box is green doe,SSI-O

52526,mine is at 390 ohms and 1.43 volts,SSI-O
52527,mines at 390 and 1.85,SSI-O
52528,mine just changed to 1.85 volts,SSI-O
52529,now its at 2.1,SSI-O
52530,"okay when I'm at 470 ohms, its's 2.34V, but that's the closest I can get",SSI-O
52531,im at 2.24 volts,SSI-O
52532,mines at 2.15 now,SSI-O
52533,"Whatever you did moved mine to 2.24 as well, so that's cool, but now it is moving down to 2.15",SSI-O
52534,2.15,SSI-O
52535,closest I can get is 2.15 - 2.45,SSI-O
52536,2.24,SSI-O
52537,mine says 2.24,SSI-O
52538,But now mine is at 1.86,SSI-O

52716,needed to me 390 ohm,SSI-O
52717,at 1.94 voltes,SSI-O
52718,Okay I'm circuit #3,SSI-O
52719,Mine is 2 V,SSI-O
52720,2,SSI-O
52721,the meter is reading all of ours together in the circuit,SSI-O

52725,600/600*8,SSI-O
52726,at 180 now,SSI-O
52727,150/600*8,SSI-O
52728,8=2(x/150+x) i think this solves the voltage drop across your resistor,SSI-O
52729,32,SSI-O
52730,i can do 180 or 220,SSI-O
52731,theres no 200,SSI-O
52732,at 180 rn,SSI-O
52733,150+r1+r2+r3=rtotal,SSI-O
52734,Voltage = 8 V,SSI-O
52735,i=8/150+r1+r2+r3,SSI-O
52736,V=iReq,SSI-O
52737,where v is going to be 2 V since yall said our goal is the same,SSI-O
52738,so 2 = ((8/150)+Req)*Req,SSI-O
52739,2=(.05333*Req+Req),SSI-O
52740,2=(.05333*Req+Req)*Req,SSI-O

52742,2=1.05333Req^2,SSI-O
52743,1.8987=req^2,SSI-O
52744,req=1.3777,SSI-O
52745,I keep using V0=V(R1/150+R1) but none of the numbers i get match the provided resistors,SSI-O
52746,V1R1 = V2R2 = V3R2,SSI-O
52747,2R1 = 2R2 = 2R3,SSI-O
52748,V0R0 = 2R1,SSI-O
52749,R1=V0R0/2,SSI-O

52756,at 560,SSI-O
52757,i have 4.2,SSI-O
52758,now i have .4,SSI-O
52759,My goal is 3.75 volts,SSI-O
52760,My goal is also 3.75 V,SSI-O
52761,im circuit 2,SSI-O
52762,Im circuit 3,SSI-O
52763,And reading 1.43 V,SSI-O
52764,My resistor is 330 ohms and reading 3.61 volts,SSI-O
52765,i think bc i changed mine yours is changing,SSI-O
52766,It changes depending on the circuit before you,SSI-O
52767,Mine is currently at 3.75 V,SSI-O
52768,now mines at 3.75,SSI-O
52769,Mine is 3.75,SSI-O
52770,goal is 9.41,SSI-O
52771,My goal is 1.38 V,SSI-O
52772,goal is 1.15,SSI-O

52774,1.38 V for circuit 3,SSI-O
52775,im 1,SSI-O
52776,1.38 V for resistor 3 **,SSI-O
52777,4.78,SSI-O
52778,im at 5.8 V,SSI-O
52779,Currently set to 120 ohms for R3,SSI-O
52780,Reading 1.38V!,SSI-O
52781,I am R3 and my goal is 3.05 V,SSI-O
52782,im r1 and goal voltage is 0.99,SSI-O
52783,im r2 and goal is 4.48 volts,SSI-O
52784,Mine is at 100 ohms,SSI-O
52785,"ok, our current is 0.0159 A",SSI-O
52786,E = 10,SSI-O
52787,mine was 4.48 volts,SSI-O
52788,I am R3 and my goal is 3.05 V,SSI-O
52789,im r2,SSI-O
52790,i am 0.99,SSI-O
52791,"r1=220. r2=998, r3 = 678ish",SSI-O
52792,Target of 4.97 V for R3,SSI-O
52793,target 1.33 r1,SSI-O
52794,r2 is 1.64,SSI-O
52795,At 100,SSI-O
52796,"r1=120, r2= 150ish, r3=460",SSI-O
52797,0,SSI-O
52798,0,SSI-O
52799,good. Ok E is 14,SSI-O
52800,0.84,SSI-O
52801,Mine is at 1.08,SSI-O
52802,i have a goal of 3.25V,SSI-O
52803,I also have a goal of 3.25 V,SSI-O
52804,mines 46.3 ohms,SSI-O
52805,220,SSI-O
52806,mine is currently at 330,SSI-O
52807,330 is the resistor that is perminately in the system,SSI-O
52808,the 330 at the top is the resistor in the circuit perminately,SSI-O
52809,like rn i have a 330 in there but my voltage is 3.4 V but when i go down one resistor value its too low voltage,SSI-O
52810,goal of 0.96V,SSI-O
52811,My goal is 3.18,SSI-O
52812,mine is 1.73,SSI-O
52813,so the current in the circuit is 0.036 amps,SSI-O
52814,the ro is the same for all of us,SSI-O
52815,5.87 is the sum of our goal voltages,SSI-O
52816,7.92-.036(R1 + R2 + R3),SSI-O
52817,So it's got 0.00968A through it,SSI-O
52818,we have .00968A through all our resistors I think,SSI-O
52819,.08-.036(...),SSI-O
52820,8-R0*I-R1I...,SSI-O
52821,E = 8 volts to R0 must have 2.13V through it,SSI-O
52822,found current thrugh R0 with that to be .00968A so we all have that current,SSI-O
52823,e is the voltage....,SSI-O
52824,i have a goal of 0.96 and im at 0.98,SSI-O
52825,ive got 1.75 and have a goal of 1.73,SSI-O
52826,im at 100 rn,SSI-O
52827,I just did 5.87V/.00968A and thats 606,SSI-O
52828,mines 100,SSI-O
52829,im at 18,SSI-O
52830,330,SSI-O
52831,Math says 328,SSI-O
52832,i have a goal of 2.88,SSI-O
52833,i have a goal of .77,SSI-O
52834,there is a total current of 4.79 mA,SSI-O
52835,1.97 esketit,SSI-O
52836,im not getting anything,SSI-O
52837,im at 100 ohm but zero voltage,SSI-O
52838,my probes were on the wire,SSI-O
52839,im getting stuff now,SSI-O
52840,i have 100 ohm resistor and .57V,SSI-O
52841,voltage back to zero,SSI-O
52842,I get an output voltage of 7,SSI-O
52843,120,SSI-O
52844,ok we currently have 1080 total ohms,SSI-O
52845,im at 100 ohm and 0.65V,SSI-O
52846,.78 V,SSI-O
52847,mine is still at 100,SSI-O
52848,E = 7 i thikn,SSI-O
52849,i did r/rtotal = v/vtotal,SSI-O
52850,I measured 7 across the wires,SSI-O
52851,Current comes out to .017,SSI-O
52852,And I get 120 ish for me,SSI-O
52853,im at .70 need .73,SSI-O
52854,with a 68 ohm,SSI-O
52855,2.88,SSI-O
52856,0.77,SSI-O
52857,r0 has 2.34v across it,SSI-O
52858,we have 4.66v total across our resistors,SSI-O
52859,1.97,SSI-O
52860,im at 2.73 and need 2.88,SSI-O
52861,I get 1.38 V across r0,SSI-O
52862,7 - all of our goals,SSI-O
52863,562 ohms,SSI-O
52864,mine is also 3V,SSI-O
52865,12 mA,SSI-O
52866,I am not getting any current through my resistor,SSI-O
52867,I just have mine on the ends of the resistor,SSI-O
52868,mine said 11.32 too,SSI-O
52869,10.53 mA now,SSI-O
52870,I still have 0 on mine,SSI-O
52871,sleet doesnt have theirs like that though,SSI-O
52872,mine says zero now and we all have the same setup,SSI-O
52873,ok so we all have them across now and it says 24 mA,SSI-O
52874,I have 2.97 V across my resistor now,SSI-O
52875,I have 2.43 V,SSI-O
52876,i have 5.26,SSI-O
52877,so we have 12 = 100* I + 2.97 + 2.43 + 5.26 so we can find current,SSI-O
52878,390 ohms,SSI-O
52879,mine is at 100,SSI-O
52880,mine says 3 V now,SSI-O

52913,"E was 10, and we all needed 2.5 volts, 10/2.5 = 4, essentially they all needed to be the same, r0 was 680",SSI-O
52914,7.16 volts,SSI-O
52915,"yeah 1.05, 7.16 and 1.92",SSI-O
52916,but if u add all of ours up its 10.13 and then divide by 11 you get 1.08,SSI-O
52917,i think though it matters what each of us are on in order to get a number,SSI-O
52918,bc each time one of yall changes resistance my number changes,SSI-O
52919,im at 100 and have 2.75,SSI-O
52920,im at 100,SSI-O
52921,ok i had 1.05 for a second,SSI-O
52922,im at 27,SSI-O
52923,27,SSI-O
52924,27,SSI-O
52925,33,SSI-O
52926,i have 1.94,SSI-O
52927,1.59,SSI-O
52928,i have 1.59,SSI-O
52929,now 1.64,SSI-O
52930,we can't have the same resistance because we needed different voltages,SSI-O
52931,i havent had 1.92 yet,SSI-O
52932,something to do with Ohm's law,SSI-O
52933,E= I*R,SSI-O
52934,Voltage = current times resistance,SSI-O
52935,"wait we say 10.13, so the voltage across r0 is .87 because they have to add up to 11",SSI-O
52936,it says 1.39,SSI-O
52937,1.25 now,SSI-O
52938,im on 7.16,SSI-O
52939,i have 1.92,SSI-O
52940,i have 2.42 volts,SSI-O

52943,mine is 6.18 with 470 ohms,SSI-O
52944,i need 2.42,SSI-O
52945,ok apparently you need a specific number,SSI-O
52946,well I=V/R,SSI-O
52947,E= (V/R)*R,SSI-O
52948,and R would cancel...,SSI-O
52949,E and V are the same,SSI-O
52950,mine is at 3.75,SSI-O
52951,now 3.91,SSI-O

52956,im at 82 ohms and 2.31,SSI-O
52957,im now at 120 and have 2.31,SSI-O
52958,we all needed to go up,SSI-O
52959,woah mine jumped,SSI-O
52960,im at 270,SSI-O
52961,150 with 3.52,SSI-O
52962,now im at 2.34 and 200,SSI-O
52963,i need mine to go up,SSI-O
52964,well all our voltages add to 13.06 so we can start from there,SSI-O
52965,E,SSI-O
52966,E=15,SSI-O
52967,i have 2.40 at 120,SSI-O

52979,4.98,SSI-O
52980,4.98,SSI-O
52981,mine is reading 0,SSI-O
52982,mine hit 4.75 then 4.98 now its at zero,SSI-O
52983,E=19 and R0=330,SSI-O
52984,E=IR,SSI-O
52985,mine is 4.75 now,SSI-O
52986,"270 and 330 give me values above and below 4.75, there isnt an option that allowa its",SSI-O
52987,okay im solidly at 4.50,SSI-O
52988,good work. so our resistors impact each other,SSI-O
52989,2.53 for that,SSI-O
52990,2.88,SSI-O
52991,3.52,SSI-O
52992,i have 1.6,SSI-O

53054,i thought i was 150,SSI-O
53055,i was either at 330 or 390,SSI-O
53056,well he dont even know,SSI-O
53057,i got 11v,SSI-O
53058,whoever just changed theirs went way too low,SSI-O
53059,or high,SSI-O
53060,my goal is 3.75,SSI-O
53061,we all have the same one,SSI-O
53062,220,SSI-O

53101,I think everyone has to get it to advance,SSI-O
53102,We would have the same set up though,SSI-O
53103,i have 2.7 there,SSI-O
53104,I have 2.7 too,SSI-O
53105,I've got 3 V now,SSI-O

53112,im at 270 ohms now,SSI-O
53113,2.4,SSI-O
53114,im still at 330,SSI-O
53115,I think we have to have different resistance values,SSI-O
53116,The tutorial showed all three having the same value. But I don't know.,SSI-O
53117,we have to add the R0 to the toatl resistance,SSI-O
53118,it is part of the circuit it is a 4th one,SSI-O
53119,I got all should add to 117.,SSI-O
53120,Amps for the circuit is in the calculator and approx. 0.0256 A,SSI-O
53121,I need 2.5 V,SSI-O
53122,I need 2.5,SSI-O
53123,I also need 2.5V,SSI-O
53124,Okay its at 2.37,SSI-O
53125,It will only either do that or 2.6,SSI-O
53126,mine is still at 2.32,SSI-O
53127,Im at 2.24,SSI-O
53128,and 2.35 v,SSI-O
53129,okay its at 2.5,SSI-O
53130,Im at 2.5 now,SSI-O
53131,i'm at 2.39,SSI-O
53132,everyone had 390 ohms,SSI-O
53133,i'm at 390,SSI-O
53134,i need 3.67 volts,SSI-O
53135,i need 6.22,SSI-O
53136,i need 3,SSI-O
53137,seagull needs the most ohms followed by me and then closely by hawk,SSI-O
53138,im at 3.09,SSI-O
53139,now I'm a 6.22,SSI-O
53140,im 2.92,SSI-O
53141,i'm at 4.23,SSI-O
53142,3.75 for me,SSI-O
53143,just went back to 3.09,SSI-O
53144,3.24,SSI-O
53145,hmm...I went too far,SSI-O
53146,im at 3.09 again,SSI-O
53147,im at 3.35,SSI-O
53148,"Okay, now I'm at 5.98",SSI-O
53149,just went up,SSI-O
53150,now at 3.53,SSI-O
53151,im at 3.53,SSI-O
53152,just went down and still at 3.09,SSI-O
53153,I'm at 6.57 but I need 6.22,SSI-O
53154,Wait I'm going up when you drop,SSI-O
53155,im at 2.55,SSI-O
53156,i need 330 volts,SSI-O
53157,im at 3.33 currently,SSI-O
53158,I'm at 7 right now,SSI-O
53159,im at 3.96,SSI-O
53160,im at 3,SSI-O
53161,3.67,SSI-O
53164,i need 1.16 volts,SSI-O
53165,2.43,SSI-O
53166,I need 2.97,SSI-O
53167,seagull will need the most resistance followed by hawk followed by eagle,SSI-O
53168,0,SSI-O
53169,270 ohms,SSI-O
53170,0 volts,SSI-O
53171,0 volts,SSI-O
53172,I have 270 ohms and 7 volts...,SSI-O
53173,im at 180,SSI-O
53174,stayed the same,SSI-O
53175,I'm still at 0 now matter what I do,SSI-O
53176,circuit is broken,SSI-O
53177,we don't know amperage,SSI-O
53178,oh mine changed to 6.99 volts,SSI-O
53179,still 0,SSI-O
53180,that's the lowest setting,SSI-O
53181,0,SSI-O
53182,no changes here,SSI-O
53183,no change,SSI-O
53184,no change,SSI-O
53185,eagle one of your green wires is out,SSI-O
53186,I've got R3,SSI-O
53187,My Voltage right now if 5.14,SSI-O
53188,Mine is 2.02,SSI-O
53189,My goal is 4.75,SSI-O
53190,My goal is 4.75,SSI-O
53191,my E=19volts and R0=470,SSI-O
53192,Mine right now is 2.02,SSI-O
53193,mine reads 7.53,SSI-O
53194,So now I'm at 1.16,SSI-O
53195,OK. I am V1 = 5.4,SSI-O
53196,ive got 7.91,SSI-O
53197,So V0 = 4.53,SSI-O
53198,My resistor is at 120 Ohms,SSI-O
53199,E=19volts,SSI-O
53200,all I know is E=I*R,SSI-O
53201,and E=sumV,SSI-O
53202,all of our voltages added up need to equal 19,SSI-O
53203,and its a series,SSI-O
53204,120 Ohms 2.07 V,SSI-O
53205,Goal: 4.75V,SSI-O
53206,im at 270ohms now,SSI-O
53207,my mulimeter reads 4.10 now,SSI-O
53208,If i put it on 330ohms my thing reads 4.79,SSI-O
53209,mine just read 4.75,SSI-O
53210,270,SSI-O
53211,4.48V 330Ohms,SSI-O
53212,390 ohms 4.87V,SSI-O
53213,Now mine is 4.12,SSI-O
53214,4.29,SSI-O
53215,im at 330ohms and it reads 4.29,SSI-O
53216,now im at 4.12,SSI-O
53217,if i do 270 it reads 3.51,SSI-O
53218,I think our ohms have to go up,SSI-O
53219,its some sort of pattern or ratio,SSI-O
53220,everyone has to be on the same resistance,SSI-O
53221,4.75,SSI-O
53222,4.75 is the goal,SSI-O
53223,2.47,SSI-O
53224,2.47,SSI-O
53225,4.29,SSI-O
53226,4.29,SSI-O
53227,4.12,SSI-O
53228,390 OHMS,SSI-O
53229,4.31,SSI-O
53230,4.52,SSI-O
53231,4.52,SSI-O
53232,at 390 mine reads 4.52,SSI-O
53233,4.75,SSI-O
53234,7.31,SSI-O
53235,oh shoot. mine is .88,SSI-O
53236,wait im R1 and i cant edit,SSI-O
53237,my goal is 4.97,SSI-O
53238,R0=390ohms,SSI-O
53239,6.58,SSI-O
53240,@560,SSI-O
53241,3.88,SSI-O
53242,5.23,SSI-O
53243,mine says 4.43 right now,SSI-O
53244,4.16,SSI-O
53245,4.16,SSI-O
53246,4.76 @470,SSI-O
53247,3.34,SSI-O
53248,4.76V 470Ohm,SSI-O
53249,"FOR R1: E=16 volts, R0= 390 ohms, goal voltage 4.97",SSI-O
53250,im at 3.34,SSI-O
53251,okay so I'm R3 and my goal is 4 volts,SSI-O
53252,My goal is also 4 volts,SSI-O
53253,Mine is also 4,SSI-O
53254,mine is 2.82,SSI-O
53255,-.16 lol,SSI-O
53256,Mine is  2.35,SSI-O
53257,Wait mine just went to zero,SSI-O
53258,Now it just says zero,SSI-O
53259,all i can do with the green wire is take it out,SSI-O
53260,and put it back in,SSI-O
53261,The resistance for all the different colors is the same,SSI-O
53262,680,SSI-O
53263,0,SSI-O
53264,Mine is zero too,SSI-O
53265,From the meter,SSI-O
53266,0,SSI-O
53267,my stuff is all plugged in,SSI-O
53268,Wait 170 isnt an option,SSI-O
53269,"I don't have a 170 either, lol",SSI-O
53270,Mine says 2.36,SSI-O
53271,and the meter said 2.36,SSI-O
53272,But resistance times current gives you vtage,SSI-O
53273,"okay so E=IR, E=16, R0=680, so I=42.5",SSI-O
53274,so the current is the same for all resistors,SSI-O
53275,On the absolute highest resistance the current gives u 16,SSI-O
53276,so 8.2kOhms divided by 4 is 2.05,SSI-O
53277,mine still says zero,SSI-O
53278,DCV 20,SSI-O
53279,14.44,SSI-O
53280,0.26,SSI-O
53281,so that it's in volts,SSI-O
53282,So then we only have resistance to wor wiht,SSI-O
53283,8.3,SSI-O
53284,If you put it on 4.7Kohms its 3.9,SSI-O
53285,I wanna see how it changes our numbers,SSI-O
53286,Mine is 5.21,SSI-O
53287,Mine is 6.28,SSI-O
53288,R=2.7 kohms,SSI-O
53289,Mine says 4.33 on 2.47,SSI-O
53290,4.33,SSI-O
53291,6.25,SSI-O
53292,we are measuring in dvc I think because we want voltage,SSI-O
53293,3.3kOhm or 3.3Mohm,SSI-O
53294,mines on 3.3kohms and reading is 4.99 volts,SSI-O
53295,MINE IS 4.99 too!!,SSI-O
53296,mine says 4.99 oo,SSI-O
53297,reading is 4.92,SSI-O
53298,im on that,SSI-O
53299,4.92,SSI-O
53300,"Ok, as we move it down its getting lower",SSI-O
53301,1kohm,SSI-O
53302,4.35,SSI-O
53303,4.35,SSI-O
53304,im at 4.35,SSI-O
53305,3.8,SSI-O
53306,3.8,SSI-O
53307,3.8,SSI-O
53308,okay I need 3.38 volts,SSI-O
53309,I need 7.23,SSI-O
53310,I need 5.08,SSI-O
53311,ikOhm,SSI-O
53312,3.38,SSI-O
53313,my probes are touching it's just part of the problem,SSI-O
53314,7.06,SSI-O
53315,3.38,SSI-O
53316,6.28,SSI-O
53317,my R0 is 150,SSI-O
53318,not the R but the E,SSI-O
53319,it says 18,SSI-O
53320,because E=IR,SSI-O
53321,mines 4.25,SSI-O
53322,mines 4.25 too,SSI-O
53323,4.25 for mine too,SSI-O
53324,i have them there,SSI-O
53325,now mine is reading zero too,SSI-O
53326,mine is reading 17 right now,SSI-O
53327,3,SSI-O
53328,my goal is 4.5,SSI-O
53329,the 20 i beleive,SSI-O
53330,180,SSI-O
53331,same but thats not getting me 4.5,SSI-O
53332,it said 4.5 a minute ago but no its 3.3,SSI-O
53333,330 works for me now,SSI-O
53334,now mine says 6.9,SSI-O
53335,mine is 6.7 lol,SSI-O
53336,18 gives me 1.4,SSI-O
53337,mine is 82,SSI-O
53338,mine its at 4.48 now,SSI-O
53339,mine is 4.3,SSI-O
53340,150 now,SSI-O
53341,mine its at 4.5,SSI-O
53342,im at 150 r,SSI-O
53343,150 r,SSI-O
53344,150 gets me 4.3,SSI-O
53345,now mine says 0,SSI-O
53346,mine unplugged ut its good now,SSI-O
53347,im at 4.5,SSI-O
53348,my goal is 1.48,SSI-O
53349,im 1.77,SSI-O
53350,6.69,SSI-O
53351,all our voltages are gonna be equal i think,SSI-O
53352,total resistance has to be 205 ohms,SSI-O
53353,"47, 68, and 100",SSI-O
53354,"10, 15, and 180",SSI-O
53355,i got 15,SSI-O
53356,it didnt change,SSI-O
53357,my measuring thing says 1.23 volts,SSI-O
53358,mine says .07,SSI-O
53359,mine says 0.1,SSI-O
53360,it doesnt change in series circuit,SSI-O
53361,7/820,SSI-O
53362,ik the voltage in R0 is 1.75 too,SSI-O
53363,cuz E is jus our 4 voltages added up,SSI-O
53364,mine just says 0.00 now,SSI-O
53365,hawk,SSI-O
53366,im circuit 3 but mine are hooked up. i got red probe on the left part of the resistor and black probe on the right part of the resistor,SSI-O
53367,so your voltage needs to read at 1.75,SSI-O
53368,mine says 1.12 rn,SSI-O
53369,1.03,SSI-O
53370,1.16,SSI-O
53371,mines low,SSI-O
53372,4*(1.75) = 7,SSI-O
53373,mine's saying 1.26,SSI-O
53374,mine says 1.81 im at 560ohms,SSI-O
53375,i put mine to 390ohms and im at 1.41V now,SSI-O
53376,mines at 470 and 1.73,SSI-O
53377,now 1.77,SSI-O
53378,mines at 560 and 1.69,SSI-O
53379,im at 470ohms and 1.30V,SSI-O
53380,560 ohms and 1.55,SSI-O
53381,now im 560ohms 1.50V,SSI-O
53382,well mine says 0 now,SSI-O
53383,nvm we good,SSI-O
53384,good now,SSI-O
53385,were good,SSI-O
53386,im at 560ohms 1.57V,SSI-O
53387,im at 1.5V,SSI-O
53388,560ohms says 1.57 for me and 680 says 1.82,SSI-O
53389,mine says the same as seagull for 560ohms and 680 ohms,SSI-O
53390,470 has me at 1.77 now,SSI-O
53391,1.79 now,SSI-O
53392,im 470ohms and 1.79V,SSI-O
53393,1.77,SSI-O
53394,1.77V,SSI-O
53395,390 330 100,SSI-O
53396,20,SSI-O
53397,"So mine says 0.00, idk if we all need to  connect or something",SSI-O
53398,as well as R0,SSI-O
53399,im getting like 22.6,SSI-O
53400,"So i have r1, and its resistance is 69",SSI-O
53401,63 now nvm,SSI-O
53402,"Ok, so mine is 13.1, while my resistor is at 5.6M olhms",SSI-O
53403,bc its the same current and same voltage drop across each one,SSI-O
53404,V=IR and all that,SSI-O
53405,so each one of our resistors will add up with the others to equal the R in V = IR,SSI-O
53406,its like 0.03 amps,SSI-O
53407,red: i think R0 is a given resistance in the series we have to solve,SSI-O
53408,I have r1 and you two have r2 and r3,SSI-O
53409,R=R0+R1+R2+R3 and R=V/I,SSI-O
53410,"I'm getting zero, no matter what",SSI-O
53411,"Nevermind, now its at 12",SSI-O
53412,330+3R1=V/I,SSI-O
53413,then 110+R1=11/3*.03,SSI-O
53414,But I'm getting a reading of '1',SSI-O
53415,They are attached to either side,SSI-O
53416,red on the left,SSI-O
53417,"Right now, I'm pointing to DCV, which is reading .28, while Amp reads 1",SSI-O
53418,if its at 120 then my voltage drop is at 2.78,SSI-O
53419,my voltage drop is 1.91,SSI-O
53420,or it was,SSI-O
53421,1.91 for me,SSI-O
53422,mines at 2.01,SSI-O
53423,we're at 2.44,SSI-O
53424,2.36,SSI-O
53425,2.28,SSI-O
53426,220 and 2.55,SSI-O
53427,or 2.83,SSI-O
53428,2.61,SSI-O
53429,2.61,SSI-O
53430,2.72!,SSI-O
53431,"It randomly changed, idk if someone did something",SSI-O
53432,mine is still reading 2.61,SSI-O
53433,im at 270 with 2.47,SSI-O
53434,im at 270 with 2.61,SSI-O
53435,270 with 2.61,SSI-O
53436,im at 270 with 2.72,SSI-O
53437,im at 270 with 2.61,SSI-O
53438,next jump is 330 and changes mine to 3.02,SSI-O
53439,"Nvmd, mine went down to 2.36",SSI-O
53440,im at 330,SSI-O
53441,At 120 with a reading of .88,SSI-O
53442,Mine says .71,SSI-O
53443,"I'm at 100 for my resistor, with a reading of .78",SSI-O
53444,im at 270,SSI-O
53445,im at 560 and close at 3.26,SSI-O
53446,need to be 3.21,SSI-O
53447,if i go down i get even further away,SSI-O
53448,"I'm at .68, needing .71",SSI-O
53449,nevermind 3.16,SSI-O
53450,im at 1.53 needing 2.2,SSI-O
53451,need a change of 10 ohms or something like that,SSI-O
53452,im at 1.8 now,SSI-O
53453,4.5,SSI-O
53454,4.5,SSI-O
53455,mine is 4.5 a;sp,SSI-O
53456,I think mine is at 470,SSI-O
53457,connected in the circuit rn is 80,SSI-O
53458,4.9,SSI-O
53459,1.31,SSI-O
53460,1.07,SSI-O
53461,okay so voltage across R0 is 0.71999...,SSI-O
53462,current is 0.00599,SSI-O
53463,7/73 v,SSI-O
53464,4.43,SSI-O
53465,1.7,SSI-O
53466,so the total voltage is 13.86+the voltage across R0,SSI-O
53467,the sum of all voltage drops is the battery's voltage,SSI-O
53468,volts,SSI-O
53469,I think e=15,SSI-O
53470,E is 15 volts,SSI-O
53471,I=0.0114,SSI-O
53472,so your goal voltage / 0.0114 = resistor value in ohms,SSI-O
53473,390,SSI-O
53474,Ie my resistor is (7.73 V)/(0.0114 A),SSI-O
53475,= 680 ohms,SSI-O
53476,Mine is set at 150,SSI-O
53477,2.75,SSI-O
53478,0.89 volts,SSI-O
53479,1.33 v,SSI-O
53480,4.97,SSI-O
53481,so E=4.97+(voltage across R0),SSI-O
53482,0.74,SSI-O
53483,im at 100 ohms,SSI-O
53484,0.75 at 100 ohms,SSI-O
53485,mine is at 1.33 @ 180 ohms,SSI-O
53486,0.75 at 100 ohms,SSI-O
53487,I=0.00766666,SSI-O
53488,im @ 180 ohms again,SSI-O
53489,680/,SSI-O
53490,2.05,SSI-O
53491,0.74,SSI-O
53492,Okay mine is at 2.22 at 390 ohms,SSI-O
53493,180 ohms at .98,SSI-O
53494,270 ohms at 1.37,SSI-O
53495,560 ohms at 2.7,SSI-O
53496,"220 ohms, 1.06 volts",SSI-O
53497,collie<poodle<spaniel in terms of resistence,SSI-O
53498,1.5V @ 330 ohms,SSI-O
53499,i have 4.5,SSI-O
53500,Same that's my goal voltage,SSI-O
53501,18=a*(270+Ru+Ri+Ro),SSI-O
53502,I need 3.5 volts,SSI-O
53503,6.09,SSI-O
53504,I need 5.67,SSI-O
53505,i need 2.17,SSI-O
53506,I need my voltage a 1.00 higher,SSI-O
53507,"Oh okay. My voltmeter keeps changing on me, so I wasn't sure.",SSI-O
53508,mine is 0.027125,SSI-O
53509,so then 390*0.012083=4.71237,SSI-O
53510,1.45+4.712+Iowa's volt+Utah's volt,SSI-O
53511,my voltage was 5.67,SSI-O
53512,mine was 10.58,SSI-O
53513,its 14,SSI-O
53514,14 volts,SSI-O
53515,"okay, let's do this again. I need 1.52 volts, my resistor is at 100 ohms and it needs to be higher",SSI-O
53516,my voltage needs to be higher I mean,SSI-O
53517,"I need .69 volts, right now I need a slightly higher resistance to get me there",SSI-O
53518,i need 6.91,SSI-O
53519,I'm at 100 ohms,SSI-O
53520,my resistor is 220 ohms,SSI-O
53521,1.52=220*I,SSI-O
53522,I=0.006909,SSI-O
53523,0.69 = 100*I,SSI-O
53524,My I = 0.0069,SSI-O
53525,1.52+.69+6.91+n=9.12+n,SSI-O
53526,220+1000+100+x=1320+x,SSI-O
53527,"it formatted it weird, 1320+x",SSI-O
53528,mine is also 0.0069,SSI-O
53529,(1320+x)=(0.0069)+(9.12+n),SSI-O
53530,R0 is the resistance of the first resistor,SSI-O
53531,sorry its (9.12+n)=(0.0069)+(1320+x),SSI-O
53532,so voltage is 13,SSI-O
53533,560 ohms,SSI-O
53534,Mine is 4.5V,SSI-O
53535,4.5,SSI-O
53536,4.5,SSI-O

53591,we dont know what R0 is though,SSI-O
53592,6.67 mA current,SSI-O
53593,that will give you the resistance,SSI-O
53594,im at 1.5 k,SSI-O

53608,1.49 is goal,SSI-O
53609,my goal is 1.24v,SSI-O
53610,mine is 10.18,SSI-O
53611,im at 9.82,SSI-O
53612,i keep hoping if i change down or up a hung it will be goal....,SSI-O
53613,at 100 ohms and 1.21 v,SSI-O
53614,100 ohms,SSI-O
53615,330,SSI-O
53616,Mines 3.5 too I dont have it,SSI-O
53617,im working on the first cicuit and my goal is the same,SSI-O
53618,ok. the best I can get is 3.66 with a 470 ohm resistor,SSI-O
53619,I'm on the 2nd,SSI-O
53620,i cant change my resistance,SSI-O
53621,i have 3.5,SSI-O
53622,goal is 1.79,SSI-O
53623,mine is 3.2,SSI-O
53624,Mine is 1.51,SSI-O
53625,ok I need 1.35 and I have 1.36,SSI-O
53626,wtf mines negative,SSI-O
53627,i need .74 and i have .71,SSI-O
53628,Mines 2.64 I need 2.88,SSI-O
53629,closest i can get now is .68,SSI-O
53630,mine is 220,SSI-O
53631,the voltage supplied is 10 volts,SSI-O
53632,I thought it was given,SSI-O
53633,it tells us its 820 ohms,SSI-O
53634,I got 1.98 I need 1.95,SSI-O
53635,mine is 820,SSI-O
53636,Mines 180,SSI-O
53637,560,SSI-O
53638,e is 18,SSI-O
53639,1560 is total,SSI-O
53640,Mines 1.95,SSI-O
53641,mine is 8.89,SSI-O
53642,6.07,SSI-O
53643,so totale is 16.91,SSI-O
53644,1.089 Volts,SSI-O
53645,R0 is 100 ohms,SSI-O
53646,cody,SSI-O
53647,i got 1.9vdc with a 82 omh,SSI-O
53648,now im at 1.33vdc,SSI-O
53649,But it is suppose to = 8 Volts,SSI-O
53650,2 volts is the target,SSI-O
53651,I got 1.56,SSI-O
53652,Voltage Supplied Of 2V,SSI-O
53653,we want 2v,SSI-O
53654,8V,SSI-O
53655,latter im thinking,SSI-O
53656,But we also have the other Resistor. Which is R0 with 100,SSI-O
53657,it would have a voltage drop of 3.05,SSI-O
53658,so we have 4.95 V left,SSI-O
53659,then we want 2V to be left over.,SSI-O
53660,Meaning we have 2.95V.,SSI-O
53661,220 ohm,SSI-O
53662,im reading zero,SSI-O
53663,im reading 0,SSI-O
53664,still 0,SSI-O
53665,yeah mines not changing for some reason,SSI-O
53666,im @470 ohms reading 2.22,SSI-O
53667,I have 180 ohm reading 0.65,SSI-O
53668,680 now with 2.21,SSI-O
53669,now 2.17,SSI-O
53670,mine is 2.14,SSI-O
53671,our goal is 0.69.,SSI-O
53672,1.98 with 680,SSI-O
53673,1.87,SSI-O
53674,2.22,SSI-O
53675,we will get the right voltage,SSI-O
53676,goal 2.14 for me,SSI-O
53677,i'm 180 ohm target 1.27 sitting pretty,SSI-O
53678,180,SSI-O
53679,@1.13,SSI-O
53680,1.19 right now,SSI-O
53681,on 180 ohms,SSI-O
53682,target is 1.27,SSI-O
53683,guessed,SSI-O
53684,10v E for mine,SSI-O
53685,we need that to finish i'd imagine,SSI-O
53686,its 10,SSI-O
53687,but multimeter doesn't seem to like that,SSI-O
53688,got 220omh in,SSI-O
53689,i.69,SSI-O
53693,"btw, setting the multimeter sets the voltage to its correct decimal place",SSI-T
53694,top of the box is your goal,SSI-T
53695,its right below the chat,SSI-T
53696,ha we could have just used the multi meter lol,SSI-T
53697,which is the bottom left side of the meter,SSI-T
53698,no exponent button smh,SSI-T
53699,which is the very bottom,SSI-T
53700,"So when u look at ur resistor, you will see different colors which you have to click and change values",SSI-T
53701,it should say it on the top,SSI-T
53702,All you need to do is click the ribbons on the resistors to change the ohm count,SSI-T
53703,"your goal voltage is shown on your screen, on top of the circuit board",SSI-T
53704,located on top of the circuit board,SSI-T
53705,on top of your circuit board,SSI-T
53706,the thing in the center,SSI-T
53707,the round thing on the board,SSI-T
53708,any color,SSI-T
53709,look under we got it!,SSI-T
53710,bottom right tiger,SSI-T
53711,the metal that is showing,SSI-T
53712,also the calculator sucks.,SSI-T
53713,either side of resistor,SSI-T
53714,under the chatbox,SSI-T
53715,The ones coming into it. I think,SSI-T
53716,where it enters and leaves the breadboard,SSI-T
53717,like the bands around the resistor,SSI-T
53718,the resistors can be changed.,SSI-T
53719,underneath the chat box,SSI-T
53720,"Don't know if someone is calculating R0, but it's above the picture.",SSI-T
53721,You can type directly unto the calc,SSI-T
53722,ok those two wires above the resistor,SSI-T
53723,i don't think it's designed to do this,SSI-T
53724,if you double tap on the resistor you can change the ohms,SSI-T
53725,it's up at the top,SSI-T
53726,top right,SSI-T
53727,i dont know why we need the current but i feel like we will,SSI-T
53728,gotta enter it at the bottom,SSI-T
53729,68,SSI-T
53730,Up top,SSI-T
53731,below,SSI-T
53732,@maynard if you click on your resistor thats the value of yours,SSI-T
53733,and you can look at the others resistances using the view all circuits button,SSI-T
53734,look at the top,SSI-T
53735,the top says what ur goal is,SSI-T
53736,Double click on the resistor and then scroll,SSI-T
53737,double click on the resistor to get the value of the resistor,SSI-T
53738,i can see it if you click on view all circuits at the top,SSI-T
53739,if you click the view all circuits button you can see how we set ours up,SSI-T
53740,well they dont allow for paper and pencil so...,SSI-T
53741,if you click on the resistor you can change it,SSI-T
53742,on the right side,SSI-T
53743,you resistor in the middle,SSI-T
53744,You can change the resistance on each of the colors,SSI-T
53745,2.05 volts at 330 ohms,SSI-T
53746,E meaning voltage I'm assuming,SSI-T
53747,read the top,SSI-T
53748,I have an idea for an alternate way to solve this conundrum if you willing for a little trial and error,SSI-U
53749,I don't exactly know,SSI-U
53750,The tutorial wasn't very clear and i've never seen a multi meter like this before,SSI-U
53751,To 20 volts I mean,SSI-U
53752,I'm not sure,SSI-U
53753,Ok I got a hang of this now,SSI-U
53754,wait that was R0,SSI-U
53755,I just relised that,SSI-U
53756,I accidentally used my voltage goal,SSI-U
53757,I don't  actually.,SSI-U
53758,I guess i didnt pay attention to the tutorials,SSI-U
53759,"Well, I am currently confused as to why I no longer have a voltage reading",SSI-U
53760,maybe i typed something in wrong,SSI-U
53761,was wondering why it was so big,SSI-U
53762,there is something we are overlooking here,SSI-U
53763,"Sorry, E = E0 + E1 + E2 + E3",SSI-U
53764,Wrong variable,SSI-U
53765,i just realized these go into megaohms,SSI-U
53766,there has to be a better way,SSI-U
53767,Ugh... I don't know a good way to do this,SSI-U
53768,"Also, I just realized that calculating the current when only one resistor is right won't help since it's not accurate then",SSI-U
53769,I don,SSI-U
53770,nevermind. I forgot that we also have to get our goal voltages,SSI-U
53771,i don't remember the calc doesn't save memory,SSI-U
53772,nevermind. E=10,SSI-U
53773,idk,SSI-U
53774,idk what to do,SSI-U
53775,ohhhhhh i forgot abput R0 being a resistor,SSI-U
53776,i think,SSI-U
53777,i give up,SSI-U
53778,I don't know bro,SSI-U
53779,I am so confused now,SSI-U
53780,idk man i just listen to you,SSI-U
53781,nvr mind,SSI-U
53782,I do :),SSI-U
53783,HEL,SSI-U
53784,HELP,SSI-U
53785,I'm a little confuse with finding the voltage,SSI-U
53786,i dont know what it wants us to do,SSI-U
53787,i dont even know what we did,SSI-U
53788,idk,SSI-U
53789,i dont even know what we did on the last one to get it right,SSI-U
53790,i dont know,SSI-U
53791,im kinda lost here guys,SSI-U
53792,this is crazy guys. it doesnt make sense,SSI-U
53793,PLIERS help us out,SSI-U
53794,nvm,SSI-U
53795,i just got the anser,SSI-U
53796,divide,SSI-U
53797,by that,SSI-U
53798,oh wait nvm,SSI-U
53799,make no sense,SSI-U
53800,nvm,SSI-U
53801,i was wrong,SSI-U
53802,help,SSI-U
53803,its harder than i thought,SSI-U
53804,Im confused on how to use the machine on the side on how to read it,SSI-U
53805,I dont even know whats happening here :p,SSI-U
53806,thats what im having problems with as well,SSI-U
53807,"I'm trying to figure out where i should set the dial on,",SSI-U
53808,this is hard @_@,SSI-U
53809,Nevermind,SSI-U
53810,I don't know what else to do at this point.,SSI-U
53811,nvm,SSI-U
53812,Not sure how to determine R0,SSI-U
53813,I'm not sure either,SSI-U
53814,I don't know,SSI-U
53815,Oopd,SSI-U
53816,Oh that makes sense,SSI-U
53817,thats strange,SSI-U
53818,idk either,SSI-U
53819,but dont rely on me i have no idea what im doing tbh,SSI-U
53820,i dont know what to do from here lol,SSI-U
53821,sos,SSI-U
53822,nevermind,SSI-U
53823,I did the calculation wrong,SSI-U
53824,ah someone messed it up nvm,SSI-U
53825,what the hell,SSI-U
53826,Not sure,SSI-U
53827,nvm,SSI-U
53828,nvm,SSI-U
53829,hi i didnt know there were more,SSI-U
53830,nevermind what i just said,SSI-U
53831,no clue,SSI-U
53832,Jk it's 329.82,SSI-U
53833,so confused man,SSI-U
53834,no idea what im doing,SSI-U
53835,thats my guess,SSI-U
53836,i dont know :(,SSI-U
53837,I still have no real idea what's going on.,SSI-U
53838,No clue,SSI-U
53839,I think,SSI-U
53840,sos,SSI-U
53841,send help,SSI-U
53842,idk how to use this meter,SSI-U
53843,i have no idea,SSI-U
53844,this is too hard,SSI-U
53845,I'm v confused,SSI-U
53846,my r isnt right,SSI-U
53847,i think,SSI-U
53848,i don't know what's going on with yours,SSI-U
53849,nvm good,SSI-U
53850,dont know what i did,SSI-U
53851,oh wait nvm,SSI-U
53852,i don't know how to set up an equation to solve for the other things though,SSI-U
53853,i dont know what to do with the loop though,SSI-U
53854,didn't know what to do with it lol,SSI-U
53855,u good im so bad at all of this,SSI-U
53856,im still confused on how u got the current tho,SSI-U
53857,im still confused on how do all of this,SSI-U
53858,or no,SSI-U
53859,i dont recall doing this,SSI-U
53860,I made a mistake,SSI-U
53861,im not sure,SSI-U
53862,idk how to do this without knowing what E is,SSI-U
53863,idk wheere to start,SSI-U
53864,how do we do this problem,SSI-U
53865,i have no clue lol,SSI-U
53866,Lol. you should be able to do it Im trying stuff. Im not sure if i'll get it.,SSI-U
53867,I'm thinking,SSI-U
53868,Not sure why mine didn't work,SSI-U
53869,nvm thern,SSI-U
53870,damn I missed one decimal place,SSI-U
53871,duh dumb me,SSI-U
53872,Idk that's strange,SSI-U
53873,"I really don't know why it's different, jokes aside",SSI-U
53874,idk what to do with that information,SSI-U
53875,my brain is too slow,SSI-U
53876,i think i know how,SSI-U
53877,i know,SSI-U
53878,i made a mistake somewhere :(,SSI-U
53879,Thanks I think I finally understand,SSI-U
53880,Im not sure how to do this,SSI-U
53881,i don't know if the current measurement worked last time,SSI-U
53882,nm,SSI-U
53883,"good quesiton, i'm still not sure how you solved the last one",SSI-U
53884,hmm alright i was wrong then,SSI-U
53885,I think,SSI-U
53886,hmm okay my ro is wrong,SSI-U
53887,i think i goofed it,SSI-U
53888,mine is very wrong,SSI-U
53889,I forget,SSI-U
53890,not sure,SSI-U
53891,like idk if amps should be 2.2 or .22,SSI-U
53892,So I don't know what I'm doing,SSI-U
53893,This is hard,SSI-U
53894,I'm so confused,SSI-U
53895,im thinking,SSI-U
53896,i feel like what we did shoulda worked,SSI-U
53897,This seems so wrong,SSI-U
53898,No clue,SSI-U
53899,nah nvm wrong number,SSI-U
53900,nvm,SSI-U
53901,maybe i calulated wrong,SSI-U
53902,problem is that I'm not sure if the current is correct,SSI-U
53903,i think,SSI-U
53904,nvm,SSI-U
53905,help,SSI-U
53906,I had some trouble. sorry.,SSI-U
53907,thats current i apologize,SSI-U
53908,I think we could do this faster now that we have the system figured out.,SSI-U
53909,oops,SSI-U
53910,hold on im messing up a little,SSI-U
53911,i'm the one thats probably messing up sorry,SSI-U
53912,idk,SSI-U
53913,im confused we got 3.24,SSI-U
53914,im so lost,SSI-U
53915,i cant figure it out,SSI-U
53916,i don't have a clue,SSI-U
53917,never mind that plan then,SSI-U
53918,im not sure of an accurate way to do this except for guessing from here,SSI-U
53919,dont know what to set my resistor to get 1.93 volts,SSI-U
53920,I don't know what to do,SSI-U
53921,Then if V= IR we take 2.64/0.024 and gives us 110 Ohms but there is only 100 and 120 resistors,SSI-U
53922,not sure if that is correct value. 622.38 volts,SSI-U
53923,sorry i meant 10 instead of 8,SSI-U
53924,nvm 1.94,SSI-U
53925,that doesnt make any sense,SSI-U
53926,idk why it changed,SSI-U
53927,im confused lol,SSI-U
53928,sorry at 5.4 V,SSI-U
53929,Im not 100% this will work btw :),SSI-U
53930,i have no idea what im doing,SSI-U
53931,im sure the way to voltage is using I*R,SSI-U
53932,how to get the proper I eludes me,SSI-U
53933,ah i think i have an idea,SSI-U
53934,im lost in the sauce,SSI-U
53935,oh nvmd so you took the total volts for us and divided by total resistance for us correct,SSI-U
53936,sorry I got it mixed up last time,SSI-U
53937,idk,SSI-U
53938,Idk,SSI-U
53939,ok im confused,SSI-U
53940,i dont do this well in my head,SSI-U
53941,dont do that,SSI-U
53942,i lost a decimal,SSI-U
53943,obviously wrong but I'm not sure why,SSI-U
53944,i might have made a calculator error,SSI-U
53945,i don't know why,SSI-U
53946,we have to many rounding errors,SSI-U
53947,well I don't know what's going on,SSI-U
53948,not sure,SSI-U
53949,"ok, im not sure what to do about that. this step only involves changing the resistance of the resistor so if that doesn't work then what...",SSI-U
53950,ight nvm,SSI-U
53951,i think,SSI-U
53952,wait i did my calc wrong,SSI-U
53953,idk man,SSI-U
53954,stuck,SSI-U
53955,oh lol I subtracted wrong,SSI-U
53956,"well i though 390, but im off",SSI-U
53957,i forgot,SSI-U
53958,Whoops,SSI-U
53959,I think I did something wrong,SSI-U
53960,ah sorry I forgot,SSI-U
53961,im not sure,SSI-U
53962,OH ok that makes so much more sense,SSI-U
53963,i dont remember,SSI-U
53964,ahhh that makes sense,SSI-U
53965,I don't know how to do that,SSI-U
53966,ahah,SSI-U
53967,i think,SSI-U
53968,"wait i'm pan, sorry",SSI-U
53969,my mistake,SSI-U
53970,"Oh, got it",SSI-U
53971,idk why,SSI-U
53972,i'm not sure,SSI-U
53973,wait nevermind the current changes too,SSI-U
53974,wait no,SSI-U
53975,oh nvm i figured it out they looked like they were attached but the program didn't pick up on it,SSI-U
53976,hm idk why we are all getting different currents,SSI-U
53977,dunno guys,SSI-U
53978,honestly so lost rn,SSI-U
53979,I'm so confused,SSI-U
53980,I'm just confused on where we get the value of I,SSI-U
53981,then I get.0019 and i dont think that is right,SSI-U
53982,i dont know,SSI-U
53983,idk,SSI-U
53984,i am confused,SSI-U
53985,welp im not sure what to try now,SSI-U
53986,i have no idea fellas. it keeps changing,SSI-U
53987,i am confused af lol,SSI-U
53988,idk i am right but we can do step by step,SSI-U
53989,that looks reasonable idk haha,SSI-U
53990,idk,SSI-U
53991,but iam not sure,SSI-U
53992,strange,SSI-U
53993,I have no idea if that is correct by any means however,SSI-U
53994,Hahahahah I have no idea how that just happened,SSI-U
53995,I'm not sure the set up of the numbers provided to be able to solve,SSI-U
53996,Mine reads .61 again though,SSI-U
53997,Yeah I am not sure what to plug in for my numbers either,SSI-U
53998,I am not sure...,SSI-U
53999,I'm not sure what to plug in,SSI-U
54000,mean,SSI-U
54001,Idk what to do,SSI-U
54002,yea nvm,SSI-U
54003,I have an idea,SSI-U
54004,im lost,SSI-U
54005,i think i understand,SSI-U
54006,i think thats how this'll work,SSI-U
54007,oh wait i forgot that,SSI-U
54008,Okay Grape i understand now,SSI-U
54009,yea i have no idea how to change the resitance of my resistor,SSI-U
54010,nvm,SSI-U
54011,i meant 150,SSI-U
54012,nvm,SSI-U
54013,780 i mean,SSI-U
54014,that is wierd yours is .01625,SSI-U
54015,im lost,SSI-U
54016,i think so not sure didnt write everything from that video,SSI-U
54017,Maybe,SSI-U
54018,just cant remember how to find that,SSI-U
54019,somehow it does matter idk,SSI-U
54020,not sure what to do next honestly,SSI-U
54021,idk how you did it tho lol,SSI-U
54022,oh nvm,SSI-U
54023,im fucking lost,SSI-U
54024,i is .0061 on my math but idk what im doing now,SSI-U
54025,nvm,SSI-U
54026,Nvm,SSI-U
54027,I forgot. lol. Think i got it though,SSI-U
54028,guess i was wrong,SSI-U
54029,i am confusing,SSI-U
54030,i think i got,SSI-U
54031,it,SSI-U
54032,i am so smart,SSI-U
54033,OH shit,SSI-U
54034,Oh wait 327,SSI-U
54035,mb 327,SSI-U
54036,hmm okay thats strange,SSI-U
54037,Good q,SSI-U
54038,i have a idea,SSI-U
54039,that's odd,SSI-U
54040,idk how,SSI-U
54041,yeah I havent figured how to solve for that one yet,SSI-U
54042,oh i see that makes sense,SSI-U
54043,im not sure what we get from doing t`hat in retrospect,SSI-U
54044,oh I see,SSI-U
54045,"Oh, mb, derp",SSI-U
54046,oh nvm i used the first number,SSI-U
54047,hmm,SSI-U
54048,well we can find it I think,SSI-U
54049,not sure if I am off by a decimal point or not,SSI-U
54050,sorry i am circuit 1 nevermind,SSI-U
54051,sort of,SSI-U
54052,nevermind,SSI-U
54053,oh wait,SSI-U
54054,whoops,SSI-U
54055,nevermind,SSI-U
54056,"actually, i dont have a clue",SSI-U
54057,"I don't know, ive never worked with this stuff before",SSI-U
54058,ive never done circuits,SSI-U
54059,but also i could be dumb i haven't done circuits since highschool,SSI-U
54060,idk bro,SSI-U
54061,my confusion hasn't,SSI-U
54062,uh I honestly have no clue what I havbe,SSI-U
54063,I don't know what the resistor is,SSI-U
54064,nvm i'm at 2.67,SSI-U
54065,nevermind,SSI-U
54066,oof never mind,SSI-U
54067,jk .16,SSI-U
54068,idk,SSI-U
54069,idk what it's actually saying. Like under omega its 104,SSI-U
54070,okay. interesting. then i am again lost,SSI-U
54071,nevermind,SSI-U
54072,literally no clue wtf is happening,SSI-U
54073,jk down,SSI-U
54074,we have no idea what were doing,SSI-U
54075,i got it guys,SSI-U
54076,Alright I see now,SSI-U
54077,Wait nevermind I lied we can just use math,SSI-U
54078,Wait no,SSI-U
54079,Hmm,SSI-U
54080,Uh oh,SSI-U
54081,It would appear that I have no clue what I am doing,SSI-U
54082,"Oh wait, I'm an idiot",SSI-U
54083,okie nvr mind,SSI-U
54084,"Yeah I'm stupid, I was doing it right the whole time",SSI-U
54085,hmmmmmmm,SSI-U
54086,Yeah I got no freakin clue as of yet,SSI-U
54087,Yeah no I think I'm doing it wrong,SSI-U
54088,I think we're onto something,SSI-U
54089,dont know how to figure r,SSI-U
54090,nvm,SSI-U
54091,i dont know boys,SSI-U
54092,i'm mad confueds how this works,SSI-U
54093,nevermind,SSI-U
54094,oh wait nvm,SSI-U
54095,"man, idk",SSI-U
54096,i forgot,SSI-U
54097,hmmm,SSI-U
54098,nvm,SSI-U
54099,oops,SSI-U
54100,nevermind it aint that lol,SSI-U
54101,hmm,SSI-U
54102,oops meant other way around,SSI-U
54103,nvm,SSI-U
54104,Idk how to work this meter,SSI-U
54105,not even sure anymore cause this keeps changing and every time i change 1 they all change,SSI-U
54106,"never mind, had to double click for some reason",SSI-U
54107,Im so confused,SSI-U
54108,What is it,SSI-U
54109,nvm,SSI-U
54110,okay idk the math then because we dont have original voltage,SSI-U
54111,I can get it to 2.29 or 1.96 i dont know what else there is to edit,SSI-U
54112,this doesn't make sense,SSI-U
54113,nevermind that made it worse go down,SSI-U
54114,i have no clue how anyone could possibly do this,SSI-U
54115,i have no clue what to do,SSI-U
54116,idk what to do,SSI-U
54117,IDK,SSI-U
54118,i see,SSI-U
54119,i messed up on the equation the 8 and the 2 should be switched,SSI-U
54120,when i do the math is says 16 ohms which doesnt make sense,SSI-U
54121,not sure,SSI-U
54122,Ah fuck,SSI-U
54123,seem to have hit a wall here,SSI-U
54124,I think i got it,SSI-U
54125,wait didnt mean to send that,SSI-U
54126,forgot there was another resistor,SSI-U
54127,Ok I think I've made some progress,SSI-U
54128,oh word i see,SSI-U
54129,Got it,SSI-U
54130,"alright, I've been going off that. nvm",SSI-U
54131,I honestly don't even know where to start,SSI-U
54132,jk i forgot about r0,SSI-U
54133,im confused as heck,SSI-U
54134,and im confused too,SSI-U
54135,"not sure, is this timed",SSI-U
54136,not sure,SSI-U
54137,i dont know if thats significant,SSI-U
54138,im still lost,SSI-U
54139,i dont,SSI-U
54140,i think,SSI-U
54141,wait nevermind idk because the measured voltage changes based on what we all put,SSI-U
54142,guess we'll never know,SSI-U
54143,no clue,SSI-U
54144,i think i know to calculate it,SSI-U
54145,yeah so im trash at electronics,SSI-U
54146,nvm,SSI-U
54147,I don't think we know it,SSI-U
54148,sorry idk what i clicked on,SSI-U
54149,so i dont know what to do here,SSI-U
54150,hmmm,SSI-U
54151,wait nevermind,SSI-U
54152,"I'm able to do it now, but I don't know what value to change it to",SSI-U
54153,no idea how im supposed to get that,SSI-U
54154,I'm between two numbers.  I can't remember between them,SSI-U
54155,Still don't know how to get E,SSI-U
54156,still not sure pon E,SSI-U
54157,No idea,SSI-U
54158,not sure,SSI-U
54159,I'm not sure,SSI-U
54160,I don't remember,SSI-U
54161,im not quite sure,SSI-U
54162,I'm not sure what else to do.,SSI-U
54163,"oh, never mind",SSI-U
54164,not sure,SSI-U
54165,weird,SSI-U
54166,idk,SSI-U
54167,idk what to do,SSI-U
54168,"I thought i understood this, but now i am very confused",SSI-U
54169,I am very lost,SSI-U
54170,Idk which one I am tho,SSI-U
54171,okay nevermind haha,SSI-U
54172,okay in our break i think i figured it out,SSI-U
54173,I think I got it too,SSI-U
54174,Welp there goes my theory,SSI-U
54175,Omg i have it!,SSI-U
54176,I think,SSI-U
54177,ehhh mostly,SSI-U
54178,Ok wait were onto something,SSI-U
54179,well im out with that one lol,SSI-U
54180,I dont know about resistors tho soooo,SSI-U
54181,"Oh my bad, I need 5.08",SSI-U
54182,i think,SSI-U
54183,nvm,SSI-U
54184,ima do my best but this stuff tough tbh,SSI-U
54185,dude i have absolutely no clue what is going on,SSI-U
54186,or maybe not im jus shootin out ideas,SSI-U
54187,idk how you got that but word sounds good,SSI-U
54188,this hard af why did the video make level 1 seem easy,SSI-U
54189,idek,SSI-U
54190,jk,SSI-U
54191,idk another way to do this,SSI-U
54192,ok then idk what to do lmao,SSI-U
54193,wait i did the subtraction wrong,SSI-U
54194,Not gonna lie I'm confused,SSI-U
54195,wait i know my mistake,SSI-U
54196,i read 4.97 as your goal collie - my bad,SSI-U
54197,lol nvm,SSI-U
54198,idk what im doing tho,SSI-U
54199,Heeeeeelp,SSI-U
54200,Nvm ignore that lol,SSI-U
54201,like my numbers keep changing at random to. this os weird,SSI-U
54202,"do you get this, the multimeter confuses me",SSI-U
54203,easy,SSI-U
54204,"this is frustrating, it would take me all of two seconds irl",SSI-U
54205,i don't get it,SSI-U
54206,see i forgot what R0 stood for but can't figure out how to go back,SSI-U
54207,nevermind my multimeter must have been lagging it went back to 1.56 yep,SSI-U
