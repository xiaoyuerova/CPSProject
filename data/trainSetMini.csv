8324,46567,sorry or confusion,SMC-R
7219,45462,ok are you pointing to the DCV thing,SESU-P
15507,53762,there is something we are overlooking here,SSI-U
12304,50551,So my target voltage is 3.75V,SSI-O
15540,53795,i just got the anser,SSI-U
3002,41238,so for this i think we need to set up a system of equations where when we change the voltage we need to calculate the total voltage and set it equal to each other and then find current,CP-S

8381,46624,omg,SMC-R
3166,41402,We should divide our voltage goal by the resistor value we have to find the current that is the same throughout the circuit. Then plug in E=IxR0 + IxR1 + IxR2 + xR3. because then we will have the same I value across the whole circuit to use,CP-S

3457,41693,i think you pull out the first lead from the circuit and connect the meter into that break,CP-S
4965,43206,same,SESU-A
13820,52068,1000,SSI-O
9757,48000,no bc total resistance is just added up between the three resistors,SN-D
9589,47832,nope,SN-D
4050,42291,bet,SESU-A
9682,47925,but thatll just give 4000,SN-D
11599,49846,180,SSI-O
3040,41276,we can try it,CP-S
13206,51454,hes checking his notes,SSI-O
14834,53084,i'm at 2.6 and 220,SSI-O
203,204,horn now just keep changing your resistance until you get to 4.25 V. It might work,CEC-R
4797,43038,Same,SESU-A
1560,30753,TigER,CMC-G
5626,43869,if so why?,SESU-P
269,270,im going to 140. that was my too high,CEC-R
15753,54008,Okay Grape i understand now,SSI-U
12950,51198,"Then R2, then R3 has the smaller resistance",SSI-O
10535,48782,V=Ir1+ir2+ir3,SSI-O
15833,54088,I think we're onto something,SSI-U
4054,42295,same,SESU-A
3938,42179,we should all have the same current,CRF-R
3881,42122,Upping your resistance decreases your voltage.,CRF-F
5648,43891,are we supposed to get an E value first?,SESU-P
9192,47435,yep,SN-A
11446,49693,I = 0.006,SSI-O
2728,40963,click on resistor and change the value if you want to,CP-S
10602,48849,3.97,SSI-O
3940,42181,The current is the same acrossed all the resistors when theyre in series,CRF-R

5097,43338,as the total current for the series circut,SESU-A
8311,46554,sigh,SMC-R
8631,46874,it's the same thing,SN-A
8749,46992,yes,SN-A
14896,53146,im at 3.09 again,SSI-O
7550,45793,5y3.y5,SMC-O
12892,51140,It didn,SSI-O
7079,45322,So 117.65/3 = 39.2 per resistor?,SESU-P
13021,51269,I get up to 4.77 volts,SSI-O
585,587,i did that,CEC-R
13720,51968,ok so the voltage drop from resistor 0 is,SSI-O
2220,31415,i think i got it,CMC-S
15285,53537,Everyones is 220 ohms,SSI-O
6156,44399,any ideas?,SESU-P
14315,52565,2.14,SSI-O

7854,46097,i am very upset,SMC-O
7447,45690,yiy,SMC-O
306,307,I fixed it,CEC-R
6623,44866,so our goal v/0.006 ma?,SESU-P
13395,51643,goal is 3.87,SSI-O
5089,43330,hahahaha same forreal,SESU-A
4059,42300,Bet,SESU-A
12698,50946,which is 0.154,SSI-O
5933,44176,how did you find that?,SESU-P
549,551,i will go 470,CEC-R
10431,48678,now 4.82,SSI-O
4850,43091,ik right,SESU-A
5092,43333,same,SESU-A
14064,52312,should be on DCV 20,SSI-O
15831,54086,Yeah I got no freakin clue as of yet,SSI-U
5226,43469,any other ideas,SESU-P
10301,48548,v=ir i guess,SSI-O

4280,42521,Okay,SESU-A
7286,45529,do we have to be under 100omhs,SESU-P
2905,41140,would you find your R,CP-S
4699,42940,that would explain it,SESU-A
5368,43611,is everyone using DCV 20?,SESU-P
6318,44561,what do yo uguys get if you guys put those numbers in there?,SESU-P
10271,48518,thats the current,SSI-O
9525,47768,not .22,SN-D
6944,45187,what circuit is what,SESU-P
663,665,I'm still trying to solve this,CEC-R
92,93,im just decreasing the resistor,CEC-R

15879,54134,and im confused too,SSI-U
694,696,pause,CEC-S
7081,45324,What are we supposed to do with that?,SESU-P
13451,51699,im .01,SSI-O
6441,44684,which resistor band have we been changing,SESU-P
6975,45218,like to start or when we were close,SESU-P
11840,50087,its saying 0 now,SSI-O
3896,42137,okay so if 1.45=120*I,CRF-F
10481,48728,that makes it go to 7.08 then drops to 6.85,SSI-O
9262,47505,"right, then use the amps we find there",SN-A
7069,45312,but how do we find it?,SESU-P
11857,50104,11-5.64-3.85=1.51,SSI-O
14133,52381,should all have same curretn in a series i thought,SSI-O

13018,51266,my goal is 1.95,SSI-O
9903,48150,Was,SSI-O
7033,45276,i guess for mine at least... do we all have the same values?,SESU-P
5754,43997,ie the original R value which I think was 6.8Kohms?,SESU-P
12145,50392,our current was the same v/r= 0.0035,SSI-O
15807,54062,uh I honestly have no clue what I havbe,SSI-U
11951,50198,4.5 V,SSI-O
9016,47259,yep,SN-A
3459,41695,I think you need to lower the resistance on yours,CP-S
15180,53432,mine is still reading 2.61,SSI-O
8879,47122,and yeah  valley youre right,SN-A
387,388,trying to calculate this shit,CEC-R
12994,51242,R3 at 390 ohms 7.7 on the meter and my goal is 7.47,SSI-O
12819,51067,i have no clue it didnt say,SSI-O
14152,52400,3.54,SSI-O
3939,42180,That's because each of our circuits affects the others. So when one changes they all change.,CRF-R
5625,43868,how,SESU-P
11327,49574,R0 = (E - 0.05)/ 0.123,SSI-O
15763,54018,just cant remember how to find that,SSI-U
14622,52872,mine says zero now and we all have the same setup,SSI-O
12681,50929,i have 1000 ohm too for R0,SSI-O
8354,46597,^^^^,SMC-R
1698,30892,we were close on getting 2,CMC-S

11301,49548,plus all our volts,SSI-O
4295,42536,ok,SESU-A
4293,42534,ROGER!?,SESU-A
2619,40854,I think we all have to change ours till each one of our voltmeters says 2.5 on it..,CP-G
7205,45448,what about now?,SESU-P
9557,47800,nope,SN-D
6366,44609,So like whats e,SESU-P

1632,30826,im .01 off,CMC-S
5281,43524,First things first is put your R0 and goal voltage,SESU-P
2202,31397,OH shit we did it,CMC-S
5316,43559,pliers what voltage do you need,SESU-P
6000,44243,so  does yours randomly seem to change? like I got it on my goal but it shifts?,SESU-P
5423,43666,do we all have to click the we got it thing?,SESU-P
8346,46589,good work guys,SMC-R

13965,52213,some one changed that,SSI-O
13961,52209,bear the resistor too,SSI-O
12933,51181,we each indivdually have our own R0,SSI-O
8983,47226,true i agree with that,SN-A
9904,48151,I was just at 4.13,SSI-O
1530,30723,someone has cut the wire,CMC-G
132,133,"ok, i think i need a 220 ohm resistor. putting it in.",CEC-R
2332,31527,but 17v is right for e,CMC-S
12396,50643,and i got 1.67,SSI-O
926,929,drop it to 120,CEC-S
4267,42508,Same,SESU-A
13389,51637,3.44,SSI-O
12863,51111,I believe it is 12/390 assuming E=IR,SSI-O
7886,46129,im falling asleep,SMC-O
3079,41315,the odd one out removes the wires from the bread board and measures the voltage,CP-S
4932,43173,ok,SESU-A
11153,49400,390,SSI-O
1917,31111,3.5 also,CMC-S
14440,52690,4.7 is my goal,SSI-O
8914,47157,yeah,SN-A
1541,30734,acton?,CMC-G
8688,46931,yea,SN-A
4206,42447,4.25,SESU-A
13811,52059,9,SSI-O
7218,45461,are your things on the outside of the resistor or somewhere else,SESU-P
9383,47626,yea,SN-A
8836,47079,yes,SN-A
5961,44204,"so who can read the amps, I think they are wrong",SESU-P
2917,41152,put your R to 820,CP-S
12553,50800,5.13 V,SSI-O
4434,42675,ooookaaaay,SESU-A
